[Features](features) > [Destination Features](destination-features) > [Configure Startup Destinations](configure-startup-destinations)


Typically in Apache ActiveMQ we [create destinations on demand](how-do-i-create-new-destinations) as clients start to use them. However sometimes users want to be able to configure which destinations are available on startup explicitly in the [Xml Configuration](xml-configuration).

> **4.1 Feature**
> 
> Note this feature is available from 4.1 onwards. If you try this XML on older versions of ActiveMQ you will get an exception about the 'destinations' property not being writable.

### Example

The following [example](http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/activemq/trunk/activemq-core/src/test/resources/org/apache/activemq/broker/destinations-on-start.xml) shows how you can configure a number of destinations to be available at startup. <broker xmlns="http://activemq.apache.org/schema/core"> <destinations> <queue physicalName="FOO.BAR" /> <topic physicalName="SOME.TOPIC" /> </destinations> </broker>
