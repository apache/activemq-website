Can I use ActiveMQ 5.0 or later on Java 1.4?
--------------------------------------------

Apache ActiveMQ 5.x or later is developed to run on Java 5 or later to take advantage of the new language features together with the major fact that on Java 5 the new concurrency code is faster & less buggy and requires less dependencies.

We may get around to creating a sepate distro of retrotranslated jars for 1.4 [particularly if someone helps](contributing).

Until then you can just [install the retrotranslator JIT in your JVM](http://retrotranslator.sourceforge.net/#jit) which will auto-swizzle all Java 5 bytecode to be complaint Java 1.4 bytecode using backport-util-concurrent instead of Java 5 concurrency code.
