Broker Properties URI
---------------------

From version 4.2 of ActiveMQ onwards the Broker Properties URI allows you to [run a configured broker](../../../../Using ActiveMQ/run-broker.md) by referencing a properties file which could be on the classpath, a local file or a remote URL.

#### Syntax

**properties:name**

Where name is some name which is resolved on the classpath, as a local file or a remote URL which points to the properties file used to configure the broker.

##### Example URI

The following examples show variations in using the URI

properties:/foo/bar.properties
properties:foo.properties
properties:http://foo.com/foo.properties

Here is [an example properties file](http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/activemq/trunk/activemq-unit-tests/src/test/resources/org/apache/activemq/config/broker.properties)
