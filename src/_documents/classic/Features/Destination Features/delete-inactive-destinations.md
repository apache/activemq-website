Inactive Destination

An 'inactive' destination is one that has had no messages pending and no consumers connected for some configured period of time.

By default the broker does _not_ check for inactive destinations. This as governed by the default values for the following options: **`schedulePeriodForDestinationPurge="0"`** and **`gcInactiveDestinations="false"`**.

However, the broker can be configured to purge inactive destinations. To do so requires using specially configured destination policy entries in combination with the broker attribute: **`schedulePeriodForDestinationPurge > 0`**.

Example:

<broker xmlns="http://activemq.apache.org/schema/core" schedulePeriodForDestinationPurge="10000">

  <destinationPolicy>
     <policyMap>
        <policyEntries>
           <policyEntry queue=">" gcInactiveDestinations="true" inactiveTimoutBeforeGC="30000"/>
        </policyEntries>
     </policyMap>
  </destinationPolicy>
      
</broker>

In this example the broker will check for inactive destinations every **`10`** seconds, as determined by **`schedulePeriodForDestinationPurge="10000"`**. When a destination purge is triggered the broker will delete any queue that has been empty for longer than **`inactiveTimoutBeforeGC="30000"`** milliseconds (default: **`60000`** milliseconds) and for which **`gcInactiveDestinations="true"`** is set on its corresponding destination policy entry.

When a destination is removed the broker will log a message like:

INFO  Queue                          - TEST.QUEUE Inactive for longer than 30000 ms - removing ...
