Apache ActiveMQ ™ -- Scaling Queues 

[Features](../../features.md) > [Horizontal Scaling](../../Features/horizontal-scaling.md) > [Scaling Queues](../../Features/Horizontal Scaling/scaling-queues.md)


Scaling to tens of thousands of Queues in a single broker is relatively straightforward - but requires some configuration changes from the default.

Reducing Threads
----------------

With the default configuration, ActiveMQ is configured to use a dispatch thread per Queue - you can use set the optimizedDispatch property on the destination policy entry - see [configuring Queues](../../Features/Destination Features/per-destination-policies.md).

ActiveMQ can optionally use internally a thread pool to control dispatching of messages - but as a lot of deployment operating systems are good at handling a large number of threads, this is off by default. To enable this option, either set the ACTIVEMQ\_OPTS to disable dedicated task runners in the start up script, INSTALL\_DIR/bin/activemq -e.g.

ACTIVEMQ_OPTS="-Xmx512M -Dorg.apache.activemq.UseDedicatedTaskRunner=false"  

or you can set ACTIVEMQ_OPTS in /etc/activemq.conf.

**Note:** From ActiveMQ 5.6 onwards the dedicated task runner is disabled by default (see .jira-issue { padding: 0 0 0 2px; line-height: 20px; } .jira-issue img { padding-right: 5px; } .jira-issue .aui-lozenge { line-height: 18px; vertical-align: top; } .jira-issue .icon { background-position: left center; background-repeat: no-repeat; display: inline-block; font-size: 0; max-height: 16px; text-align: left; text-indent: -9999em; vertical-align: text-bottom; } [AMQ-3667](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-3667?src=confmacro) ).

To reduce the number of threads used for the transport - take a look at using the NIO transport - see [Configuring Transports](../../Using ActiveMQ/configuring-transports.md)

Here is an [example](http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/activemq/trunk/assembly/src/sample-conf/activemq-scalability.xml) of this in use in one of the provided sample broker configuration files.

Reducing Memory Consumption
---------------------------

Reduce the memory used per thread - see [reducing memory consumption](../../FAQ/Errors/Exceptions/javalangoutofmemory.md)

Reduce number of file descriptors
---------------------------------

ActiveMQ uses the amqPersistenceAdapter by default for persistent messages. Unfortunately, this persistence adapter (as well as the kahaPersistenceAdapter) opens a file descriptor for each queue. When creating large numbers of queues, you'll quickly run into the limit for your OS.

You can either choose another [persistence option](../../Features/persistence.md)

or - try out the new [KahaDB](../../Features/Persistence/kahadb.md) in version 5.3 and higher

Increase the limit on file descriptors per process
