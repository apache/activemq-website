Apache ActiveMQ ™ -- How do I use durable subscribers in a network of brokers

Durable subscribers behave a little differently across a cluster of ActiveMQ brokers. The two main issues surround messages getting stuck on other brokers in the network after a durable subscriber has disconnected and reconnected to a different broker in the network without fully unsubscribing. The reasons for disconnecting/reconnecting can be voluntary (where the subscriber is using the failover transport), or involuntary (one of the brokers in the cluster fails).

For example, if you have two brokers A and B networked together in both directions to form a cluster, and a durable subscriber connects to broker B, a producer P on broker A will have its messages properly forwarded to broker B and the durable subscriber. However, if the subscriber disconnects and reconnects to broker A, any messages sent by P while the subscriber was away will be stuck on B until the subscriber reconnects to B.

The solution is to use [Virtual Destinations](../../Features/Destination Features/virtual-destinations.md)

Virtual topics use queues under the covers and this allows ActiveMQ to treat each subscriber as a plain old Queue subscriber. This allows ActiveMQ to replay messages that have been orphaned on another broker in the cluster using this configuration as explained in the [Networks of Brokers](../../Features/Clustering/networks-of-brokers.md) documentation:

    <destinationPolicy>
      <policyMap>
        <policyEntries>
          <policyEntry queue="TEST.>" enableAudit="false">
            <conditionalNetworkBridgeFilterFactory replayWhenNoConsumers="true"/>
          </policyEntry>
        </policyEntries>
      </policyMap>
    </destinationPolicy>
