#### Replacing non-inclusive terms throughout source code, comments, and documentation
Moving forward, we will replace master/slave with 2 nouns to denote configured state and 2 adjectives to denote runtime state, and we will need to use those consistently across code and documentation for both brokers as follows: 

**Nouns:** Primary/Backup  
**Adjectives:** Active/Passive

These changes will take time to fully implement so please bear with us during this transition.
