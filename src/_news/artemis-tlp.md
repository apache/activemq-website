#### Summary

In order to provide greater clarity and dedicated focus for our
communities, especially our users, the Apache ActiveMQ PMC has decided
to establish two distinct Apache Top-Level Projects: Apache ActiveMQ
and Apache Artemis.

Both projects are highly active with vibrant communities, and this
separation will grant each project better visibility and autonomy.
Moving forward, each project will evolve independently with dedicated
governance, fostering their unique development paths. This
reorganization also presents a significant opportunity for new
contributions to both projects.

What does this mean concretely in the coming days? We will operate as
two independent Top-Level Projects, each with its own domain
([activemq.apache.org](https://activemq.apache.org) and [artemis.apache.org](https://artemis.apache.org)). It also means that each
project will establish and manage its own dedicated resources,
including websites, mailing lists, Slack channels, and issue trackers.
These resources will become available in the coming weeks. In the
mean-time, development and releases will continue on existing paths.

Stay tuned for more updates,

The Apache ActiveMQ PMC


UPDATE: The new [Apache Artemis website](https://artemis.apache.org) is now live. Head there for more details such as mailing list information etc.
