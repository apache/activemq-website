### Symptoms

I get an exception saying **No suitable driver** when initialising the JDBC driver.

### Reason

ActiveMQ tries to auto-detect the JDBC driver so that it can deduce the ultimate database's SQL dialect. Some JDBC drivers are not yet auto-recognised. Here's [how to configure the language adapater class to use or to provide us with details of your driver so we can add support for it to ActiveMQ](jdbc-support).
