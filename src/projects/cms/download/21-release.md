New and Noteworthy
------------------

This version includes several bugfixes, as well as some new features. Also a lot of work has been done on performance and memory leaks. One new feature that has been highly anticipated is that we now build both shared and static libraries.

**NOTE:** Compatable with ActiveMQ Broker versions in the 4.0 family
