Do not use Safari to download, the above URLs use redirection

The above URLs use the Apache Mirror system to redirect you to a suitable mirror for your download. Some users have experienced issues with some versions of browsers (e.g. some Safari browsers). If the download doesn't seem to work for you from the above URL then try using [FireFox](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/)

Verify the Integrity of Downloads
---------------------------------

It is essential that you verify the integrity of the downloaded files using the PGP or MD5 signatures. The PGP signatures can be verified using PGP or GPG. Begin by following these steps:

1.  Download the [KEYS](http://www.apache.org/dist/activemq/KEYS)
2.  Download the asc signature file for the relevant distribution
3.  Verify the signatures using the following commands, depending on your use of PGP or GPG:
    ```
    $ pgpk -a KEYS
    $ pgpv apache-activemq-<version>-bin.tar.gz.asc
    ```
    or
    ```
    $ pgp -ka KEYS
    $ pgp apache-activemq-<version>-bin.tar.gz.asc
    ```
    or
    ```
    $ gpg --import KEYS
    $ gpg --verify apache-activemq-<version>-bin.tar.gz.asc
    ```

(Where <version> is replaced with the actual version, e.g., 5.1.0, 5.2.0, etc.).

Alternatively, you can verify the MD5 signature on the files. A Unix program called `md5` or `md5sum` is included in most Linux and Unix distributions. It is also available as part of [GNU Textutils](http://www.gnu.org/software/textutils/textutils.html). Windows users can utilize any of the following md5 programs:

*   [md5](http://www.fourmilab.ch/md5/)
*   [md5sums](http://www.pc-tools.net/win32/md5sums/)
*   [SlavaSoft FSUM](http://www.slavasoft.com/fsum/)

Getting the Binaries using Maven 2
----------------------------------

To use this release in your maven project, the proper dependency configuration that you should use in your [Maven POM](http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-pom.html) is:
