Whether you have a simple question about configuration, a use-case you're confused about, a new feature you want to discuss, etc. the community is here to help.

If you're fairly certain you're hitting a bug [please report it](issues) via one of our issue trackers.

#### Mailing Lists

The *best* way to contact folks in the community is by using one of the mailing lists. We have two main mailing lists - the **users** list and the **dev** list. Choose the right list based on whether you're deploying or using ActiveMQ or you're a developer working directly on one of the ActiveMQ code-bases. You can interact with the list via web-based forum if that suits you better.

To subscribe to or unsubscribe from a list simply:

 1. Send a blank email to the appropriate address (see below).
 1. The automated mailing list manager will send an reply (either a confirmation request or an error message, e.g. if you are not subscribed).
 1. Reply to the confirmation message.

|List|Subscribe|Unsubscribe|Archives|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Users|[users-subscribe@activemq.apache.org](mailto:users-subscribe@activemq.apache.org)|[users-unsubscribe@activemq.apache.org](mailto:users-unsubscribe@activemq.apache.org)|[Apache](http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/activemq-users/), [Markmail](http://activemq.markmail.org/search/list:org.apache.activemq.users)|
|Dev|[dev-subscribe@activemq.apache.org](mailto:dev-subscribe@activemq.apache.org)|[dev-unsubscribe@activemq.apache.org](mailto:dev-unsubscribe@activemq.apache.org)|[Apache](http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/activemq-dev/), [Markmail](http://activemq.markmail.org/search/list:org.apache.activemq.dev)|

Mailing list participants are expected to abide by the well-established rules of "netiquette", as well as the ASF's published [Code of Conduct](https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct.html).

**Please read these [tips for email contributors](https://apache.org/dev/contrib-email-tips.html)**, especially if you're not getting the support you expect. 

If you're curious you can [read more](https://apache.org/foundation/mailinglists.html) about how these lists work at Apache.


#### Chat

If for some reason a mailing list doesn't work for you then you can potentially chat with other community members in real-time using **[Slack](https://slack.com/)**. 

**Slack** is a relatively new and productive collaboration platform. Access to the [ASF Slack](https://the-asf.slack.com) requires an invitation. If you want an invitation to the ActiveMQ Slack channel simply send a request to the [users mailing list](#mailing).
