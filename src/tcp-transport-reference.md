### The TCP Transport

The TCP transport allows clients to connect to a remote ActiveMQ broker using a TCP socket. These configuration options can be used to tune the underlying TCP transport on either the client-side using the JMS client's connection URI string or on a broker's transport connector URI.

Use Correct Prefix!

The options below should be prefixed with `**transport.***` when used on a broker's transport connector definition. On the client-side, however, the **`transport.*`** prefix _must_ be omitted.

#### Configuration Syntax

`**tcp://hostname:port?key=value**`

##### Examples

Broker side (in **`TransportConnector`**):

tcp://localhost:61616?transport.threadName&transport.trace=false&transport.soTimeout=60000

Client side (in **`brokerURL`**):

tcp://localhost:61616?threadName&trace=false&soTimeout=60000

##### Transport Options

Option Name

Default Value

Description

`backlog`

`5000`

Specifies the maximum number of connections waiting to be accepted by the transport server socket.

`closeAsync`

`true`

If **`true`** the socket close call happens asynchronously. This parameter should be set to **`false`** for protocols like STOMP, that are commonly used in situations where a new connection is created for each read or write. Doing so ensures the socket close call happens synchronously. A synchronous close prevents the broker from running out of available sockets owing to the rapid cycling of connections. 

`connectionTimeout`

`30000`

If **`>=1`** the value sets the connection timeout in milliseconds. A value of **`0`** denotes no timeout. Negative values are ignored.

`daemon`

`false`

If **`true`** the transport thread will run in daemon mode. Set this parameter to **`true`** when embedding the broker in a Spring container or a web container to allow the container to shut down correctly.

`diffServ`

`0`

(Client only) The preferred Differentiated Services traffic class to be set on outgoing packets, as described in RFC 2475. Valid integer values: **`[0,64]`**. Valid string values: **`EF`, `AF[1-3][1-4]`** or **`CS[0-7]`**.

With JDK 6, only works when the JVM uses the IPv4 stack. To use the IPv4 stack set the system property **`[java.net](http://java.net).preferIPv4Stack=true`**.

`Note**: it's invalid to specify both **`diffServ`** and **`typeOfService`** at the same time as they share the same position in the TCP/IP packet headers.

`dynamicManagement`

`false`

If **`true`** the **`TransportLogger`** can be managed by JMX.

`ioBufferSize`

`8 * 1024`

Specifies the size of the buffer to be used between the TCP layer and the OpenWire layer where **`wireFormat`** based marshaling occurs.

`jmxPort`

`1099`

(Client Only)

Specifies the port that will be used by the JMX server to manage the **`TransportLoggers`**. This should only be set, via URI, by either a client producer or consumer as the broker creates its own JMX server.

Specifying an alternate JMX port is useful for developers that test a broker and client on the same machine and need to control both via JMX.

`keepAlive`

`false`

If **`true`,** enables [TCP KeepAlive](http://tldp.org/HOWTO/TCP-Keepalive-HOWTOoverview) on the broker connection to prevent connections from timing out at the TCP level.

This should _not_ be confused with **`KeepAliveInfo`** messages as used by the **`InactivityMonitor`.**

`logWriterName`

`default`

Sets the name of the **`org.apache.activemq.transport.LogWriter`** implementation to use.

Names are mapped to classes in the **`resources/META-INF/services/org/apache/activemq/transport/logwriters`** directory.

`maximumConnections`

`Integer.MAX_VALUE`

The maximum number of sockets allowed for this broker.

`minmumWireFormatVersion`

`0`

The minimum remote **`wireFormat`** version that will be accepted (note the misspelling).

`Note**: when the remote **`wireFormat`** version is lower than the configured minimum acceptable version an exception will be thrown and the connection attempt will be refused.

A value of `**0**` denotes no checking of the remote **`wireFormat`** version.

`socketBufferSize`

`64 * 1024`

Sets the size, in bytes, for the accepted socket's read and write buffers.

`soLinger`

`Integer.MIN_VALUE`

Sets the socket's option **`soLinger`** when the value is **`> -1`**.

When set to **`-1`** the **`soLinger`** socket option is disabled.

`soTimeout`

`0`

Sets the socket's read timeout in milliseconds.

A value of `**0**` denotes no timeout.

`soWriteTimeout`

`0`

Sets the socket's write timeout in milliseconds. If the socket write operation does not complete before the specified timeout, the socket will be closed.

A value of **0** denotes no timeout.

`stackSize`

`0`

Set the stack size of the transport's background reading thread. Must be specified in multiples of **`128K`**.

A value of `**0**` indicates that this parameter is ignored.

`startLogging`

`true`

If **`true`** the **`TransportLogger`** object of the Transport stack will initially write messages to the log.

This parameter is ignored unless **`trace=true`**.

`tcpNoDelay`

`false`

If **`true`** the socket's option **`TCP_NODELAY`** is set. This disables Nagle's algorithm for small packet transmission.

`threadName`

`N/A`

When this parameter is specified the name of the thread is modified during the invocation of a transport. The remote address is appended so that a call stuck in a transport method will have the destination information in the thread name. This is extremely useful when using thread dumps for degugging.

`trace`

`false`

Causes all commands that are sent over the transport to be logged.

To view the logged output define the **`Log4j`** logger: **`log4j.logger.org.apache.activemq.transport.TransportLogger=DEBUG`**.

`trafficClass`

`0`

The Traffic Class to be set on the socket.

`typeOfService`

`0`

(Client only) The preferred Type of Service value to be set on outgoing packets. Valid integer values: **`[0,256]`**.

With JDK 6, only works when the JVM is configured to use the IPv4 stack. To use the IPv4 stack set the system property **`[java.net](http://java.net).preferIPv4Stack=true`**.

`Note**: it's invalid to specify both **`diffServ`** and **`typeOfService`** at the same time as they share the same position in the TCP/IP packet headers.

`useInactivityMonitor`

`true`

When **`false`** the `**InactivityMonitor**` is disabled and connections will never time out.

`useKeepAlive`

`true`

When **`true` `KeepAliveInfo`** messages are sent on an idle connection to prevent it from timing out.

If this parameter is **`false`** connections will still timeout if no data was received on the connection for the specified amount of time.

`useLocalHost`

`false`

When **`true`** local connections will be made using the value **`localhost`** instead of the actual local host name.

On some operating systems, such as **`OS X`**, it's not possible to connect as the local host name so **`localhost`** is better.

`useQueueForAccept`

`true`

When **`true`** accepted sockets are placed onto a queue for asynchronous processing using a separate thread.

`wireFormat`

`default`

The name of the **`wireFormat`** factory to use.

`wireFormat.*`

`N/A`

Properties with this prefix are used to configure the **`wireFormat`**.

See [Configuring Wire Formats](configuring-wire-formats) for more information.

##### Differentiated Services or Types of Service

There is support for setting Differentiated Services - as outlined in [IETF RCF 2475](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2475). In order to configure the broker so that all outgoing packets from the broker match the DSCP values set on incoming packets - you will need to apply IP Tables scripts - found [here](tcp-transport-reference.data/brokerConfig.tar.gz?version=1&modificationDate=1273219000000&api=v2).
