There are a zillion different things we could do to visualise the system. Lets use this page to braindump ideas for what kinds of visualisations we could do

*   show visually the popularity of certain destinations; using size/color/position/stats to indicate hot areas of the system
*   visually show the queue sizes & stats?
*   could we link the nodes somehow to some web page or something?
