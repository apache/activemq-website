[Using ActiveMQ 5](using-activemq-5) > [Version 5 Initial Configuration](version-5-initial-configuration)

Firstly you need to add the jars to your classpath.

Required JARs
-------------

To make ActiveMQ easy to use, the default **activemq-all.jar** comes complete with all the libraries required. If you prefer to have explicit control over all the jars used by ActiveMQ here is the full list of individual jars required

*   activemq-broker.jar
*   activemq-client.jar
*   activemq-kahadb-store.jar
*   activemq-spring.jar
*   hawtbuf-1.11.jar
*   slf4j-api.jar
*   slf4j-log4j12.jar
*   log4j-1.2.17.jar
*   J2EE APIs which could be the j2ee.jar from Sun or your J2EE container or you could use Geronimo's freely distributable geronimo-spec-j2ee.jar. If you are inside a servlet container and being dependent on the j2ee.jar causes you troubles, the parts of the J2EE jar we are dependent on are as follows...
    *   geronimo-spec-jms.jar
    *   geronimo-spec-jta.jar
    *   geronimo-spec-j2ee-management.jar

If you want to grab a J2EE specification jar we recommend the Apache [repository](http://cvs.apache.org/repository/geronimo-spec/jars/)

Optional JARS
-------------

*   spring.jar - if you wish to use the XML configuration file for configuring the Message Broker

*   if you wish to use message persistence then you need to add a persistent jar to your classpath (see below). If you just want a lightweight message bus with no durability you can leave this step out but we highly recommend persistence for production deployments.

Persistence support
-------------------

The default persistence is the [AMQ Message Store](Persistence/amq-message-store). We do still support persistence via [JDBC and a high performance journal](persistence). For full explict control over configuration check out the [Xml Configuration](xml-configuration).

If you're just doing some testing or in-VM SEDA based messaging you may wish to disable persistence. You can use the [Xml Configuration](xml-configuration) for this.

You can do this by setting the usePersistence property to false either in the [Xml Configuration](xml-configuration) or on the [broker URL](configuring-transports).

Next steps
----------

One of the first things you might want to do is [start a broker](run-broker). Once you have a broker running you could try using the [JNDI Support](jndi-support) which shows how to run an example JMS program. Or there are some other [example programs](examples)

If you don't want to use JNDI you can just instantiate an [ActiveMQConnectionFactory](http://activemq.codehaus.org/maven/apidocs/org/apache/activemq/ActiveMQConnectionFactory.html), configure its properties directly and then you're ready to use the standard JMS API to create Connections, Sessions, MessageProducer and MessageConsumer instances.
