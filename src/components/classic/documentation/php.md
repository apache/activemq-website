PHP Support
-----------

For PHP support we recommend the PHP Stomp Client. A list of available clients for PHP is available [here](http://stomp.codehaus.org/implementations.html).  
Among others you can grab a stomp-php client from [here](http://stomp.fusesource.org/release/php/1.0/stomp-php-1.0.0.tar.gz)
