Python Support
--------------

For Python support we recommend the [Python Stomp Client](http://stomp.github.com/implementations.html)

Alternatively, you can try [pyactivemq](http://code.google.com/p/pyactivemq/), which is a Python wrapper for the ActiveMQ C++ Library. Because the ActiveMQ C++ library supports both Stomp and Openwire, pyactivemq does too.
