For many secured environments there's a requirement to log every user management action. For that ActiveMQ Classic implements _audit logging_, which means that every management action made through JMX or Web Console management interface will be logged and available for later inspection.

Audit logging comes pre-configured with the distribution, so it's very easy to turn it on or off. All you have to do is to set `org.apache.activemq.audit` system property.  From 5.16.0 the value can be one of "true|entry|exit|all". When the value is all or exit, the audit captures the time the JMX operation completed. You can do that by uncommenting the following line in the startup script:
```
ACTIVEMQ_OPTS="$ACTIVEMQ_OPTS -Dorg.apache.activemq.audit=true"
```
The actual logs are by default stored in `${ACTIVEMQ_HOME}/data/audit.log` and for secured broker you may expect entries similar to the following:
```

```
In this example you can see sample entries for actions taken both in Web Console or via JMX. Log entries contain info like:

*   username (if available), or "anonymous" otherwise
*   Operation performed, which in JMX case is the method name and request URL if the operation is performed over web
*   Parameters used for the operation and
*   IP address from which call has been made

A default location of the audit log can be configured in `${ACTIVEMQ_HOME}/conf/log4j.properties`
