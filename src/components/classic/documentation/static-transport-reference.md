### The Static Transport

The static transport provides a hard coded mechanism to discover other connections using a list of URIs. A connection using this discovery mechanism will attempt to connect to all URIs in the list until it is succesful.

#### Configuration Syntax

`static:(uri1,uri2,uri3,...)?options**

#### Example URI

static:(tcp://localhost:61616,tcp://remotehost:61617?trace=false,vm://localbroker)?initialReconnectDelay=100

##### Options


Option Name|Default Value|Description
---|---|---
initialReconnectDelay|10|How long to wait before the first reconnect attempt (in ms)
maxReconnectDelay|30000|The maximum amount of time we ever wait between reconnect attempts (in ms)
useExponentialBackOff|true|Should an exponential backoff be used btween reconnect attempts
backOffMultiplier|2|The exponent used in the exponential backoff attempts
maxReconnectAttempts|0|If not 0, then this is the maximum number of reconnect attempts before an error is sent back to the client
minConnectTime|500|If a connaction fails faster than this amount of time then it is considered a connection failure

##### Notes

As the static transport protocol is for broker discovery, it should not be used by client programs. Clients wishing to failover to a static list of broker instances, should use the [failover://](failover-transport-reference) transport instead.
