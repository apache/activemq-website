If you get an error something like this...
```

```
when you are trying to use SSL to connect to ActiveMQ Classic then the "certificate_unknown" error shows on the broker when the client doesn't trust the broker's certificate. On the client, I would see an error as well: "No trusted certificate found".

### Fix

Make sure that you exported the broker's certificate (step 2 in [How do I use SSL](how-do-i-use-ssl)) and imported it on the client into a truststore (step 4). If you did those, did you specify the javax.net.ssl.trustStore system property when you started your client VM?
