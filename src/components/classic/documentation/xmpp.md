XMPP Protocol Support (Jabber!)
-------------------------------

> **Deprecated**
> 
> This transport was deprecated in 5.8.0 and has been removed in a 5.9.0!

We have support for [XMPP](http://www.xmpp.org/) (Jabber) as a transport in ActiveMQ Classic.

To use just add a connector as follows
```
<broker xmlns="http://activemq.org/config/1.0">
  <transportConnectors>
     <transportConnector name="openwire" uri="tcp://localhost:61616" discoveryUri="multicast://default"/>
     <transportConnector name="stomp"    uri="stomp://localhost:61613"/>
     <transportConnector name="xmpp"     uri="xmpp://localhost:61222"/>
  </transportConnectors>
</broker>
```
And you can now use XMPP to connect to the broker & send and receive messages.

> Some versions of the broker (5.0-5.2) does not include [WoodStox](http://woodstox.codehaus.org/) library by default, which could impact ActiveMQ Classic XMPP funcionality. You should have a library named like `wstx-asl-x.x.x.jar` in the `lib/optional` directory of your broker. If that's not the case, download it from [here](http://woodstox.codehaus.org/) and put it in the classpath

### XMPP Support in Apache ActiveMQ Classic

ActiveMQ Classic provides a bidirectional bridge between ActiveMQ Classic messages and XMPP.

*   if a client joins a chatroom / conference room, the name of the conference room is mapped to a JMS topic of the same name
*   typing into a chatroom sends a message to the topic
*   presence in a chatroom maintains a subscription on the JMS topic (using noLocal to avoid getting copies of things you say) so that messages sent by other clients (via [XMPP](xmpp), the [Web Console](web-console), the [Examples](examples) or any other [Cross Language Clients](cross-language-clients)) are then sent to the chatroom.

### Using a Jabber Client

Basically, you should be able to connect from any Jabber-compatible client to the broker. The below example is using [Spark](http://jivesoftware.com/products/spark/) 2.0.0 version. For more details on connecting with different clients take a look at [#Jabber clients compatibility](xmpp).

To connect to Apache ActiveMQ Classic try the following...

1. Run the [Web Console](web-console)  
2. Start [Spark](http://jivesoftware.com/products/spark/) or whatever Jabber Client you wish  
3. Login to localhost:61222

    > Some Jabber clients (like iChat) insist on usernames in forms of _username@host_, so in that case just append _@localhost_ to your username

    > Some Jabber clients like to auto-discover the host and port. You need to explicitly disable this feature so you can explicitly configure **localhost** as the host and **61222** as the port.
    > 
    > e.g. on Spark go to the **Advanced** tab and disable the **Automatically discover host and port**

4. You should now see the following screen...

    ![](assets/img/step2.png)

5. Now click on the **Join Conference Room** button (next to the Add Contact button) and the following dialog should appear

    ![](assets/img/step3.png)

6. Now press the **Create or Join Room** button to get the following dialog. Enter a JMS topic name, in this case **foo.bar** and you're good to go...

    ![](assets/img/step4.png)

7. Now your chat window should appear for talking and listening to the topic **foo.bar**. So start typing to test things out. 

    ![](assets/img/step5.png)

8. Now if you go to the [Topic Console](http://localhost:8161/admin/topics.jsp) in the Web Console you should see the topic has been created

    ![](assets/img/step6-new.png)

9. If you now click on the **Send To** link next to the **foo.bar** topic you can send a message to the topic from the web console. 

    ![](assets/img/step7-new.png)

10. Press send and you should see the chat appear on the chat window

### Jabber clients compatibility

Here you can find specfic issues and workarounds for various Jabber clients. If you have some of your own, please post them here.

#### Spark

Url: [http://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/spark/index.jsp](http://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/spark/index.jsp)  
Spark 2.0.0 works fine with ActiveMQ Classic; Click [here](http://www.igniterealtime.org/downloads/download-landing.jsp?file=spark/spark_2_ 0_0.exe) to download: [Spark 2.0.0 for Windows](http://www.igniterealtime.org/downloads/download-landing.jsp?file=spark/spark_2_0_0.exe).  
Spark 2.5.x connects fine, but it won't open the **Join Conference Room** dialog.

#### iChat

Url: [http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/ichat.md](http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/ichat)  
Tested version 4.0.7 works fine, but it insists you use _username@host_ format for usernames

#### Adium

Url: [http://www.adiumx.com/](http://www.adiumx.com/)  
Tested version 1.3.3 works fine. The only spotted issue is reconnecting to [Command Agent](command-agent) topic. We recommend that you restart the Adium if you need to do this
