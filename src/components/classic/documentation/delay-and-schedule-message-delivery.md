ActiveMQ Classic from version **5.4** has an optional persistent scheduler built into the ActiveMQ Classic message broker. It is enabled by setting the broker **schedulerSupport** attribute to true in the [Xml Configuration](xml-configuration).
An ActiveMQ Classic client can take advantage of a delayed delivery by using the following message properties:

> **Check your Message Properties**
> 
> The message property `scheduledJobId `is reserved for use by the Job Scheduler. If this property is set before sending, the message will be sent immediately and not scheduled. Also, after a scheduled message is received, the property `scheduledJobId` will be set on the received message so keep this in mind if using something like a Camel Route which might automatically copy properties over when re-sending a message.

Property name|type|description
---|---|---
AMQ_SCHEDULED_DELAY|long|The time in milliseconds that a message will wait before being scheduled to be delivered by the broker
AMQ_SCHEDULED_PERIOD|long|The time in milliseconds to wait after the start time to wait before scheduling the message again
AMQ_SCHEDULED_REPEAT|int|The number of times to repeat scheduling a message for delivery
AMQ_SCHEDULED_CRON|String|Use a Cron entry to set the schedule

For the connivence of Java JMS clients - there's an interface with the property names used for scheduling at _**org.apache.activemq.ScheduledMessage**_.

For example, to have a message scheduled for delivery in 60 seconds - you would need to set the _AMQ_SCHEDULED_DELAY_ property:
```java
MessageProducer producer = session.createProducer(destination);
TextMessage message = session.createTextMessage("test msg");
long time = 60 * 1000;
message.setLongProperty(ScheduledMessage.AMQ_SCHEDULED_DELAY, time);
producer.send(message);
```
You can set a message to wait with an initial delay, and the repeat delivery 10 times, waiting 10 seconds between each re-delivery:
```java
MessageProducer producer = session.createProducer(destination);
TextMessage message = session.createTextMessage("test msg");
long delay = 30 * 1000;
long period = 10 * 1000;
int repeat = 9;
message.setLongProperty(ScheduledMessage.AMQ_SCHEDULED_DELAY, delay);
message.setLongProperty(ScheduledMessage.AMQ_SCHEDULED_PERIOD, period);
message.setIntProperty(ScheduledMessage.AMQ_SCHEDULED_REPEAT, repeat);
producer.send(message);
```
You can also use [CRON](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) to schedule a message, for example, if you want a message scheduled to be delivered every hour, you would need to set the CRON entry to be - `0 * * * *` - e.g.
```java
MessageProducer producer = session.createProducer(destination);
TextMessage message = session.createTextMessage("test msg");
message.setStringProperty(ScheduledMessage.AMQ_SCHEDULED_CRON, "0 * * * *");
producer.send(message);
```
CRON scheduling takes priority over using message delay - however, if a repeat and period is set with a CRON entry, the ActiveMQ Classic scheduler will schedule delivery of the message for every time the CRON entry fires. Easier to explain with an example. Supposing that you want a message to be delivered 10 times, with a one second delay between each message - and you wanted this to happen every hour - you'd do this:
```java
MessageProducer producer = session.createProducer(destination);
TextMessage message = session.createTextMessage("test msg");
message.setStringProperty(ScheduledMessage.AMQ_SCHEDULED_CRON, "0 * * * *");
message.setLongProperty(ScheduledMessage.AMQ_SCHEDULED_DELAY, 1000);
message.setLongProperty(ScheduledMessage.AMQ_SCHEDULED_PERIOD, 1000);
message.setIntProperty(ScheduledMessage.AMQ_SCHEDULED_REPEAT, 9);
producer.send(message);
```
