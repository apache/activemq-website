Subject: Invitation to become Apache Active committer

Hello <INVITEE>,

The Apache ActiveMQ Project Management Committee (PMC) hereby offers you committer privileges to the project. These privileges are offered on the understanding that you'll use them reasonably and with common sense. We like to work on trust rather than unnecessary constraints.

Being a committer enables you to more easily make changes without needing to go through the patch submission process. Although you will be granted commit access to project repositories, you will be expected to adhere to project best practices when committing. The following URL some good resources regarding expectations and processes:

[http://www.apache.org/dev/new-committers-guide.html](http://www.apache.org/dev/new-committers-guide.html)

This is a personal invitation for you to accept or decline in private. Please reply to the [private@activemq.apache.org](mailto:private@activemq.apache.org) address only.

If you accept the invitation, the next step is to register an Individual Contributor License Agreement (ICLA) with the Apache Software Foundation if you have not already. Details of the ICLA and the forma can be found at the following URL:

[http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas)

The form provides instructions for its completion and submittal to the Secretary of the ASF.

When you submit the completed ICLA, please request to notify the Apache ActiveMQ project upon official receipt.Once your ICLA has been acknowledged by the Secretary, you will need to choose a unique ASF ID. You can check to see if your preferred id is already taken by browsing the following list of ASF committers:

[http://people.apache.org/committer-index.html](http://people.apache.org/committer-index.html)

When your ICLA is recognized by the Secretary, you will receive a follow-up message with the next steps for establishing you as a committer.

We look forward to your response!
