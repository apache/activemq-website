Pure restart of the embedded broker is not advisable, since it's state could be corrupted. Therefore, you're advised to instantiate the broker again before restarting it.
```
BrokerService service = BrokerFactory.createBroker("xbean:activemq.xml");
service.start();
service.waitUntilStarted();

service.stop();
service.waitUntilStopped();

service = BrokerFactory.createBroker("xbean:activemq.xml");
service.start();
```
In 5.3 however, we allowed the force start of the broker that has been stopped for use cases that need this functionality. You can do it by using
```
BrokerService.start(boolean force);
```
method.

The following example demonstrates it.
```
BrokerService service = BrokerFactory.createBroker("xbean:activemq.xml");
service.start();
service.waitUntilStarted();

service.stop();
service.waitUntilStopped();

service.start(true);
```
However, it's better (more reliable) to instantiate the broker again if it is possible.
