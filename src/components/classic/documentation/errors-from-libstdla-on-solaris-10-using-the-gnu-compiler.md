On Solaris 10 the libstdc++.la file is empty which causes the build to fail. In order to fix this you must fill in the libstdc++.la file with the correct information. There are two versions, one for 32 bit and one for 64 bit. The following listings show the correct contents of these files respectively.

From [Sun Forums](http://forum.java.sun.com/thread.jspa?threadID=5073150)

Note that this doesn't seem to get us all the way. For some reason the shared library dependencies can't seem to all be resolved so you must build only static libraries. This can be accomplished by passing the following to the configure script.

 
./configure --enable-shared=no
