New Features in 4.2
-------------------

The 4.2 version was renamed to 5.0 due to some changes in [OpenWire](openwire) requiring a major version number increase, plus 5.0 being dependent by default on Java 5 to take advantage of the faster and more bug-free java.util.concurrent code.

So please refer to the [New Features in 5.0](new-features-in-50)
