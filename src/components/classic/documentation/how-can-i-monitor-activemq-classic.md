How can I monitor ActiveMQ Classic
----------------------------------

ActiveMQ Classic comes bundled with [Jolokia](http://www.jolokia.org/) which provides a RESTful interface to ActiveMQ Classic's JMX capabilities. An open source third party tool that connects via Jolokia is [hawt.io](http://hawt.io/), an HTML-5 web console with an ActiveMQ Classic plugin that is at least worth being familiar with as ActiveMQ Classic and hawt.io share developers.

In ActiveMQ Classic you can monitor the broker to see what destinations are being used, their activity along with connections and subscriptions using the following tools

*   [JMX](jmx) and a JMX console such as [jConsole](http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/J2SE/jconsole.html)
*   The [Web Console](web-console)
*   the [Advisory Message](advisory-message) feature (using JMS messages to monitor the system)
*   The [Command Agent](command-agent); ActiveMQ.Agent topic that you query for status
*   The [Visualisation](visualisation) plug-in
*   The [Statistics](statisticsplugin) plug-in
