You can monitor ActiveMQ Classic using the [Web Console](web-console) by pointing your browser at

[http://localhost:8161/admin](http://localhost:8161/admin)

From ActiveMQ Classic 5.8 onwards the web apps is secured out of the box.  
The default username and password is admin/admin. You can configure this in the conf/jetty-real.properties file.

Or you can use the [JMX](jmx) support to view the running state of ActiveMQ Classic.

For more information see the file `docs/WebConsole-README.txt` in the distribution.
