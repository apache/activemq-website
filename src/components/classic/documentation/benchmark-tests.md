ActiveMQ Classic Maven Performance test plugin.
---------------------------------------

Starting with ActiveMQ Classic 5.5 and above the plugin can be obtained from maven or if you download the src from GIT you can build it yourself. To run the following Maven goals make sure you are inside a Maven2 project directory where its POM is enabled with the Maven2 plugin. The plugin is further documented [here](activemq-classic-performance-module-users-manual).
