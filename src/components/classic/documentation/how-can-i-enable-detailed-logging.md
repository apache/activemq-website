How can I enable detailed logging
---------------------------------

We use [slf4j](https://www.slf4j.org/) which allows the underlying logging implementation to be statically bound at startup. 
 
By default we ship with log4j but feel free to make your own choice.

If you've got log4j.jar on your classpath you can use a log4j.properties file to configure the logging levels. See the [log4j.properties example](https://github.com/apache/activemq/blob/main/activemq-broker/src/test/resources/log4j.properties) for the kind of thing you'll need.

e.g. adding the following to your log4j.properties will enable tracing of ActiveMQ Classic code:

in 4.x
```
log4j.logger.org.apache.activemq=INFO
log4j.logger.org.apache.activemq.spring=WARN
```
in 3.x
```
log4j.logger.org.activemq=TRACE
```

### Getting help on log4j

Since ActiveMQ Classic 5.17.0, ActiveMQ Classic uses [log4j2](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/index.html). You can find log4j2 documentation [here](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/index.html).

ActiveMQ Classic 5.16.4+ uses [reload4j](https://reload4j.qos.ch/), a fork of log4j1 containing important security fixes, with the same configuration as log4j1.

Before ActiveMQ Classic 5.16.4, ActiveMQ Classic uses [log4j1](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/manual.html).
