### The TCP Transport

The TCP transport allows clients to connect to a remote ActiveMQ Classic broker using a TCP socket. These configuration options can be used to tune the underlying TCP transport on either the client-side using the JMS client's connection URI string or on a broker's transport connector URI.

Note: Use Correct Prefix!

The options below should be prefixed with **`transport.*`** when used on a broker's transport connector definition. On the client-side, however, the **`transport.*`** prefix _must_ be omitted.

#### Configuration Syntax

**`tcp://hostname:port?key=value`**

##### Examples

Broker side (in **`TransportConnector`**):

tcp://localhost:61616?transport.threadName&transport.trace=false&transport.soTimeout=60000

Client side (in **`brokerURL`**):

tcp://localhost:61616?threadName&trace=false&soTimeout=60000

##### Transport Options

Option Name|Default Value|Description
---|---|---
backlog|5000|Specifies the maximum number of connections waiting to be accepted by the transport server socket.
closeAsync|true|If **`true`** the socket close call happens asynchronously. This parameter should be set to **`false`** for protocols like STOMP, that are commonly used in situations where a new connection is created for each read or write. Doing so ensures the socket close call happens synchronously. A synchronous close prevents the broker from running out of available sockets owing to the rapid cycling of connections. 
connectionTimeout|30000|If **`>=1`** the value sets the connection timeout in milliseconds. A value of **`0`** denotes no timeout. Negative values are ignored.
daemon|false|If **`true`** the transport thread will run in daemon mode. Set this parameter to **`true`** when embedding the broker in a Spring container or a web container to allow the container to shut down correctly.
dynamicManagement|false|If **`true`** the **`TransportLogger`** can be managed by JMX.
ioBufferSize|8 * 1024|Specifies the size of the buffer to be used between the TCP layer and the OpenWire layer where **`wireFormat`** based marshaling occurs.
jmxPort|1099|(Client Only) Specifies the port that will be used by the JMX server to manage the **`TransportLoggers`**. This should only be set, via URI, by either a client producer or consumer as the broker creates its own JMX server. Specifying an alternate JMX port is useful for developers that test a broker and client on the same machine and need to control both via JMX.
keepAlive|false|If **`true`,** enables [TCP KeepAlive](http://tldp.org/HOWTO/TCP-Keepalive-HOWTOoverview) on the broker connection to prevent connections from timing out at the TCP level. This should _not_ be confused with **`KeepAliveInfo`** messages as used by the **`InactivityMonitor`.**
logWriterName|default|Sets the name of the **`org.apache.activemq.transport.LogWriter`** implementation to use. Names are mapped to classes in the **`resources/META-INF/services/org/apache/activemq/transport/logwriters`** directory.
maximumConnections|Integer.MAX_VALUE|The maximum number of sockets allowed for this broker.
minmumWireFormatVersion|0|The minimum remote **`wireFormat`** version that will be accepted (note the misspelling). Note: when the remote **`wireFormat`** version is lower than the configured minimum acceptable version an exception will be thrown and the connection attempt will be refused. A value of **`0`** denotes no checking of the remote **`wireFormat`** version.
socketBufferSize|64 * 1024|Sets the size, in bytes, for the accepted socket's read and write buffers.
soLinger|Integer.MIN_VALUE|Sets the socket's option **`soLinger`** when the value is **`> -1`**. When set to **`-1`** the **`soLinger`** socket option is disabled.
soTimeout|0|Sets the socket's read timeout in milliseconds. A value of **`0`** denotes no timeout.
soWriteTimeout|0|Sets the socket's write timeout in milliseconds. If the socket write operation does not complete before the specified timeout, the socket will be closed. A value of **0** denotes no timeout.
stackSize|0|Set the stack size of the transport's background reading thread. Must be specified in multiples of **`128K`**. A value of **`0`** indicates that this parameter is ignored.
startLogging|true|If **`true`** the **`TransportLogger`** object of the Transport stack will initially write messages to the log. This parameter is ignored unless **`trace=true`**.
tcpNoDelay|false|If **`true`** the socket's option **`TCP_NODELAY`** is set. This disables Nagle's algorithm for small packet transmission.
threadName|N/A|When this parameter is specified the name of the thread is modified during the invocation of a transport. The remote address is appended so that a call stuck in a transport method will have the destination information in the thread name. This is extremely useful when using thread dumps for degugging.
trace|false|Causes all commands that are sent over the transport to be logged. To view the logged output define the **`Log4j`** logger: **`log4j.logger.org.apache.activemq.transport.TransportLogger=DEBUG`**.
trafficClass|0|The Traffic Class to be set on the socket.
diffServ|0|(Client only) The preferred Differentiated Services traffic class to be set on outgoing packets, as described in RFC 2475. Valid integer values: **`[0,64]`**. Valid string values: **`EF`, `AF[1-3][1-4]`** or **`CS[0-7]`**. With JDK 6, only works when the JVM uses the IPv4 stack. To use the IPv4 stack set the system property **`java.net.preferIPv4Stack=true`**. Note: it's invalid to specify both '**diffServ** and **typeOfService**' at the same time as they share the same position in the TCP/IP packet headers
typeOfService|0|(Client only) The preferred Type of Service value to be set on outgoing packets. Valid integer values: **`[0,256]`**. With JDK 6, only works when the JVM is configured to use the IPv4 stack. To use the IPv4 stack set the system property **`java.net.preferIPv4Stack=true`**. Note: it's invalid to specify both '**diffServ** and **typeOfService**' at the same time as they share the same position in the TCP/IP packet headers.
useInactivityMonitor|true|When **`false`** the **`InactivityMonitor`** is disabled and connections will never time out.
useKeepAlive|true|When **`true` `KeepAliveInfo`** messages are sent on an idle connection to prevent it from timing out. If this parameter is **`false`** connections will still timeout if no data was received on the connection for the specified amount of time.
useLocalHost|false|When **`true`** local connections will be made using the value **`localhost`** instead of the actual local host name. On some operating systems, such as **`OS X`**, it's not possible to connect as the local host name so **`localhost`** is better.
useQueueForAccept|true|When **`true`** accepted sockets are placed onto a queue for asynchronous processing using a separate thread.
wireFormat|default|The name of the **`wireFormat`** factory to use.
wireFormat.*|N/A|Properties with this prefix are used to configure the **`wireFormat`**.

See [Configuring Wire Formats](configuring-wire-formats) for more information.

##### Differentiated Services or Types of Service

There is support for setting Differentiated Services - as outlined in [IETF RCF 2475](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2475). In order to configure the broker so that all outgoing packets from the broker match the DSCP values set on incoming packets - you will need to apply IP Tables scripts - found [here](tcp-transport-reference.data/brokerConfig.tar.gz?version=1&modificationDate=1273219000000&api=v2).
