Perl Support
------------

For Perl support we recommend the use of the [Stomp protocol](http://activemq.apache.orgConnectivity/Protocols/stomp). There are various Perl Stomp clients available, such as

* [Net::STOMP::Client Perl](http://search.cpan.org/dist/Net-STOMP-Client/)  
* [Net::Stomp Perl](http://search.cpan.org/dist/Net-Stomp/)

Both are hosted on [CPAN.org](http://www.cpan.org).

A more exhausting list of Stomp client libraries for Perl is available on [stomp.github.com](http://stomp.github.com//implementations.html).
