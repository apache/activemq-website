### Scenario

You are using the **vm:** transport and a broker is auto-started for you so that your configured embedded broker doesn't start.

### Solution

Its most likely a dependency issue; your JMS connection is starting before your embedded broker. So just make sure your embedded broker is started first.

Another cause could be that your use of the [VM Transport](vm-transport-reference) defines a broker name of localhost whereas your embedded broker uses a different name; so just be consistent in the naming.

ActiveMQ Classic 5.2 adds the waitForStart='timeout in milliseconds' option to the VM transport which forces the VM transport to wait till the broker is started. Coupled with the "create=false" option, it is possible to ensure that a single embedded broker is auto-started.
