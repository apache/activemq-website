New and Noteworthy
------------------

This is a new Major release of ActiveMQ-CPP with several new APIs and internal changes meant to improve overall stability of the C++ client. Besides a large amount of bug fixing and memory fixing this release also features a lot of new features in the CMS API:

*   Added Message Transformation capabilities for incoming and outgoing messages.
*   You can now query for the type of a Message property so you can choose the best getter method.
*   MapMessage and StreamMessage object now expose an API to find out what type a value is before you try to get a value using one of the getter methods.
*   Polling consumers now can set a Message available listener.
*   Stomp clients can configure the destination prefixes for the Destination types (Queues, Topics...).
*   StreamMessage now has a reset method to allow object reuse.
*   Added an AdvisorySupport class to make dealing with advisory topics easier.
*   Added support for non-blocking sends to Message Producers.  

**NOTE:** Compatible with ActiveMQ Broker versions in the 4.X and 5.X family
