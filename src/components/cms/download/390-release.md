This is a new major release that resolves a number of issues found since the 3.8.x series was released.  The client has been updated to include many of the same fixes that were placed into the ActiveMQ JMS client.  Additional fixes for memory leaks and segfaults have been added as well. 

**NOTE:** Compatible with ActiveMQ Broker versions in the 4.X and 5.X family
