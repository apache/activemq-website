## Connecting To the Broker

### Adding A Connection

Once you have navigated to the *connect* page click on the *Add connection* button and fill in the Jolokia endpoint configuration
of your broker. You will be able to test the connection before creating:

Once the connection is added simply click the *Connect* button of your broker and this should open up a new tab and prompt for a login attempt.
Login and ypu should see  the console to 2 Artemis Menu items.

## Navigating the Artemis Views

There are 2 Artemis views that are available from the left hand menu the **Artemis** View and the **Artemis JMX** view.
The former navigates around resources using a JMX tree and exposes the JMX Attributes and Operations of each MBean as well as
functionality exposed. The second is a set of tabs that exposes similar functionality but in tabular gviews and is not 
related to specific mbeans.

<a id="artemis-jmx-view"></a>
### Artemis JMX View
Click **Artemis JMX** in the left navigation bar to see the Artemis JMX specific plugin. (The Artemis tab won’t appear if there is no 
broker in this JVM). The Artemis plugin works very much the same as the JMX plugin however with a focus on interacting with an Artemis broker.

#### Tree View
The tree view on the left-hand side shows the top level JMX tree of each broker instance running in the JVM. Expanding 
the tree will show the various MBeans registered by Artemis that you can inspect via the Attributes tab. When a specific 
MBean is selected in the tree a set of related tabs become visible

<img src= "treeview.png" width="1200" alt="Connection Image" style="border: 2px solid grey;">


#### Default Tabs

All MBeans will show the following tabs by default which are exposed on all Mbeans.

##### Attributes

The **Attributes** tab shows all attributes that are configured on an MBean if permissions allow. Depending on the permissions of the user
these may be editable.

##### Operations

The **Operations** Tab exposes a list of JMX operations that the selected MBean exposes. Depending on a users permissions
these can be executed by expanding each operation.


##### Chart

The **Chart** tab allows you to view numerical data of an MBean along a time series.

#### Address Tabs

If the MBean selected is an Address MBean which are found under the *addresses* leaf in the tree then you will see the following tabs if permissions allow.

##### Create Queue

This tab will allow the user to create queues that are bound to the address that is selected. It exposes the ability to 
configure a sub set of available paramaters on the queue, however extra configuration not exposed  can be configured 
using a set of key/value pairs, for instance delay-before-dispatch or auto-delete.

##### Delete Address

The **Delete** tab allows you to delete an address completely. 

> NOTE: The Address can only be deleted if it has no queues and cannot be undone.

##### Send Message

This **Send Message** tab allows the user to send a message to an address, this in turn will route it to any queues that are bound to this address.

It allows message headers to be added and a body. Note that the message type created is always a Text Message.

> NOTE:  The sending of the message will be authenticated using the current logon user, unselect *use current logon user* to use a different user.


#### Queue Tabs

If the MBean selected is a *Queue* MBean then teh following tabs are displayed.

> NOTE: Queue MBeans are found under the  *Address* Mbean it is bound to.
>

#### Browse Messages

{% include browse.md %}

##### Browse a Message

It is possible to view the contents of a message by clicking on the 3 dots to the right of the message and clicking the
*view* button. This will open up a dialog box showing the body, headers and properties of the message.

<img src= "viewmessage.png" width="600" alt="Connection Image" style="border: 2px solid grey;">

Note that the body of the message may not be viewable if it is not of type Text Message. All other messages are shown as
bytes and will be transformed depending on the **Browse Bytes Messages** setting which can be set in the **preferences**.

> NOTE: large messages are also truncated to protect the browser this can be configured in Artemis [Address Settings](https://activemq.apache.org/components/artemis/documentation/latest/address-settings.html#address-settings)


>NOTE: The columns show can be configured by clicking on the *Manage Columns* link and selecting which columns should be shown.
> The column configuration is persisted to the browsers local storage and will be retrieved for each browser session.

##### Delete Queue

The **Delete Queue** tab allows you to either delete the whole queue or purge messages, that is remove all the messages in the queue.

Both will open a dialog box to confirm the operation. This operation cannot be undone.


##### Send Message

This **Send Message** tab allows the user to send a message directly to a queue, Note that unlike the **Send Message** to 
an address this will bypass any messages routing semantics and be placed directly on the queue.

It allows message headers to be added and a body. Note that the message type created is always a Text Message.

> NOTE:  The sending of the message will be authenticated using the current logon user, unselect *use current logon user* to use a different user.

### Artemis View

Click Artemis in the left navigation bar to see the Artemis specific plugin. (The Artemis tab won’t appear if there is no
broker in this JVM). The **Artemis View** unlike the JMX view is more orientated around paginating over the Brokers resources 
such as Addresses and Queue. The same functionality though is available as in the JMX view. The following tabs are available 
in the Artemis view.

All of the tabs in the **Artemis View** that show tabulated data will allow the user to configure which columns to show. This is persisted in the sessions local storage and available when a new session is started.

#### Status

The **Status** tab is the default tab shown after login and shows the basic state of the broker, including uptime, the

### Security

#### Jolokia Access

The Jolokia JMX-HTTP bridge is secured via a policy file in the broker configuration directory: 'etc/jolokia-access.xml'. 
The contents of that file should be modified as described in the [Jolokia Security Guide](https://jolokia.org/features/security.html). 
By default the console is locked down to 'localhost', pay particular attention to the 'CORS' restrictions when exposing the console web endpoint over the network.

#### MBean Access

Access to MBeans is configured in ActiveMQ Artemis, see the [Management via JMX](https://activemq.apache.org/components/artemis/documentation/) chapter.

Certain screen and tab visibility is controlled by the access to a specific JMX Operation, for instance the **Create Queue** 
tab is only shown if the user has access to the create queue JMX operation.
