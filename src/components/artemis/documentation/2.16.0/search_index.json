For a\ndescription of MoMs and other messaging concepts please see the Messaging Concepts.\n\n\nWhy use Apache ActiveMQ Artemis? Here are just a few of the reasons:\n\n100% open source software. Apache ActiveMQ Artemis is licensed using the Apache\nSoftware License v 2.0 to minimise barriers to adoption.\n\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis is designed with usability in mind.\n\nWritten in Java. Runs on any platform with a Java 8+ runtime, that's\neverything from Windows desktops to IBM mainframes.\n\nAmazing performance. Our ground-breaking high performance journal\nprovides persistent messaging performance at rates normally seen for\nnon-persistent messaging, our non-persistent messaging performance\nrocks the boat too.\n\nFull feature set. All the features you'd expect in any serious\nmessaging system, and others you won't find anywhere else.\n\nElegant, clean-cut design with minimal third party dependencies. Run\nActiveMQ Artemis stand-alone, run it in integrated in your favourite Java EE\napplication server, or run it embedded inside your own product. It's\nup to you.\n\nSeamless high availability. We provide a HA solution with automatic\nclient failover so you can guarantee zero message loss or\nduplication in event of server failure.\n\nHugely flexible clustering. Create clusters of servers that know how\nto load balance messages. Link geographically distributed clusters\nover unreliable connections to form a global network. Configure\nrouting of messages in a highly flexible way.\n\n\n"},"project-info.html":{"url":"project-info.html","title":"Project Info","keywords":"","body":"Project Information\nThe official Apache ActiveMQ Artemis project page is http://activemq.apache.org/artemis/.\nSoftware Download\nThe software can be download from the Download\npage:http://activemq.apache.org/artemis/download.html\nProject Information\n\nIf you have any user questions please use our user\nforum\n\nIf you have development related questions, please use our developer\nforum\n\nPop in and chat to us in our IRC\nchannel\n\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis Git repository is https://github.com/apache/activemq-artemis\n\nAll release tags are available from\nhttps://github.com/apache/activemq-artemis/releases\n\n\nAnd many thanks to all our contributors, both old and new who helped\ncreate Apache ActiveMQ Artemis.\n"},"versions.html":{"url":"versions.html","title":"Versions","keywords":"","body":"Versions\nThis chapter provides the following information for each release:\n\nA link to the full release notes which includes all issues resolved in the release.\nA brief list of \"highlights\" when applicable.\nIf necessary, specific steps required when upgrading from the previous version. \nNote: If the upgrade spans multiple versions then the steps from each version need to be followed in order.\nNote: Follow the general upgrade procedure outlined in the Upgrading the Broker \nchapter in addition to any version-specific upgrade instructions outlined here.\n\n\n\n2.14.0\nFull release notes.\nHighlights:\n\nManagement methods to update diverts\nAbility to \"disabled\" a queue so that messages are not routed to it\nSupport JVM GC & thread metrics\nSupport for resetting queue properties by unsetting them in broker.xml\nUndeploy diverts by removing them from broker.xml\nAdd addressMemoryUsagePercentage and addressSize as metrics\n\nUpgrading from older versions\nMake sure the existing queues have their parameters set according to the broker.xml values before upgrading.\n2.13.0\nFull release notes.\nHighlights:\n\nManagement methods for an address' duplicate ID cache to check the cache's size and clear it\nSupport for min/max expiry-delay\nPer-acceptor security domains\nCommand-line check tool for checking the health of a broker\nSupport disabling metrics per address via the enable-metrics address setting\nImprovements to the audit logging\nSpeed optimizations for the HierarchicalObjectRepository, an internal object used to store address and security settings\n\nUpgrading from older versions\nVersion 2.13.0 added new audit logging\nwhich is logged at INFO level and can be very verbose. The\nlogging.properties shipped with this new version is set up to filter this out\nby default.

Most messaging systems also\nsupport a request-response mode but this is not a primary feature of messaging\nsystems.\nDesigning systems to be asynchronous from end-to-end allows you to really take\nadvantage of your hardware resources, minimizing the amount of threads blocking\non IO operations, and to use your network bandwidth to its full capacity. With\nan RPC approach you have to wait for a response for each request you make so\nare limited by the network round trip time, or latency of your network. With\nan asynchronous system you can pipeline flows of messages in different\ndirections, so are limited by the network bandwidth not the latency. This\ntypically allows you to create much higher performance applications.\nMessaging systems decouple the senders of messages from the consumers of\nmessages. The senders and consumers of messages are completely independent and\nknow nothing of each other. This allows you to create flexible, loosely coupled\nsystems.\nOften, large enterprises use a messaging system to implement a message bus\nwhich loosely couples heterogeneous systems together. Message buses often form\nthe core of an Enterprise Service\nBus. (ESB). Using a\nmessage bus to de-couple disparate systems can allow the system to grow and\nadapt more easily. It also allows more flexibility to add new systems or retire\nold ones since they don't have brittle dependencies on each other.\nMessaging styles\nMessaging systems normally support two main styles of asynchronous messaging:\nmessage queue messaging (also\nknown as point-to-point messaging) and publish\nsubscribe messaging.  We'll\nsummarise them briefly here:\nPoint-to-Point\nWith this type of messaging you send a message to a queue. The message is then\ntypically persisted to provide a guarantee of delivery, then some time later\nthe messaging system delivers the message to a consumer.  The consumer then\nprocesses the message and when it is done, it acknowledges the message. Once\nthe message is acknowledged it disappears from the queue and is not available\nto be delivered again. If the system crashes before the messaging server\nreceives an acknowledgement from the consumer, then on recovery, the message\nwill be available to be delivered to a consumer again.\nWith point-to-point messaging, there can be many consumers on the queue but a\nparticular message will only ever be consumed by a maximum of one of them.\nSenders (also known as producers) to the queue are completely decoupled from\nreceivers (also known as consumers) of the queue - they do not know of each\nother's existence.\nA classic example of point to point messaging would be an order queue in a\ncompany's book ordering system. Each order is represented as a message which is\nsent to the order queue. Let's imagine there are many front end ordering\nsystems which send orders to the order queue. When a message arrives on the\nqueue it is persisted - this ensures that if the server crashes the order is\nnot lost. Let's also imagine there are many consumers on the order queue - each\nrepresenting an instance of an order processing component - these can be on\ndifferent physical machines but consuming from the same queue. The messaging\nsystem delivers each message to one and only one of the ordering processing\ncomponents.  Different messages can be processed by different order processors,\nbut a single order is only processed by one order processor - this ensures\norders aren't processed twice.\nAs an order processor receives a message, it fulfills the order, sends order\ninformation to the warehouse system and then updates the order database with\nthe order details. Once it's done that it acknowledges the message to tell the\nserver that the order has been processed and can be forgotten about. Often the\nsend to the warehouse system, update in database and acknowledgement will be\ncompleted in a single transaction to ensure\nACID properties.\nPublish-Subscribe\nWith publish-subscribe messaging many senders can send messages to an entity on\nthe server, often called a topic (e.g. in the JMS world).\nThere can be many subscriptions on a topic, a subscription is just another\nword for a consumer of a topic. Each subscription receives a copy of each\nmessage sent to the topic. This differs from the message queue pattern where\neach message is only consumed by a single consumer.\nSubscriptions can optionally be durable which means they retain a copy of\neach message sent to the topic until the subscriber consumes them - even if the\nserver crashes or is restarted in between. Non-durable subscriptions only last\na maximum of the lifetime of the connection that created them.\nAn example of publish-subscribe messaging would be a news feed. As news\narticles are created by different editors around the world they are sent to a\nnews feed topic. There are many subscribers around the world who are interested\nin receiving news items - each one creates a subscription and the messaging\nsystem ensures that a copy of each news message is delivered to each\nsubscription.\nDelivery guarantees\nA key feature of most messaging systems is reliable messaging. With reliable\nmessaging the server gives a guarantee that the message will be delivered once\nand only once to each consumer of a queue or each durable subscription of a\ntopic, even in the event of system failure. This is crucial for many\nbusinesses; e.g. you don't want your orders fulfilled more than once or any of\nyour orders to be lost.\nIn other cases you may not care about a once and only once delivery guarantee\nand are happy to cope with duplicate deliveries or lost messages - an example\nof this might be transient stock price updates - which are quickly superseded\nby the next update on the same stock. The messaging system allows you to\nconfigure which delivery guarantees you require.\nTransactions\nMessaging systems typically support the sending and acknowledgement of multiple\nmessages in a single local transaction. Apache ActiveMQ Artemis also supports\nthe sending and acknowledgement of message as part of a large global\ntransaction - using the Java mapping of XA: JTA.\nDurability\nMessages are either durable or non durable. Durable messages will be persisted\nin permanent storage and will survive server failure or restart. Non durable\nmessages will not survive server failure or restart. Examples of durable\nmessages might be orders or trades, where they cannot be lost. An example of a\nnon durable message might be a stock price update which is transitory and\ndoesn't need to survive a restart.\nMessaging APIs and protocols\nHow do client applications interact with messaging systems in order to send and\nconsume messages?\nSeveral messaging systems provide their own proprietary APIs with which the\nclient communicates with the messaging system.\nThere are also some standard ways of operating with messaging systems and some\nemerging standards in this space.\nLet's take a brief look at these:\nJava Message Service (JMS)\nJMS is part of Oracle's\nJava EE specification. It's a Java API that encapsulates both message queue and\npublish-subscribe messaging patterns. JMS is a lowest common denominator\nspecification - i.e. it was created to encapsulate common functionality of the\nalready existing messaging systems that were available at the time of its\ncreation.\nJMS is a very popular API and is implemented by most messaging systems.  JMS is\nonly available to clients running Java.\nJMS does not define a standard wire format - it only defines a programmatic API\nso JMS clients and servers from different vendors cannot directly interoperate\nsince each will use the vendor's own internal wire protocol.\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis provides a fully compliant JMS 1.1 and JMS 2.0 client\nimplementation.\nSystem specific APIs\nMany systems provide their own programmatic API for which to interact with the\nmessaging system. The advantage of this it allows the full set of system\nfunctionality to be exposed to the client application. API's like JMS are not\nnormally rich enough to expose all the extra features that most messaging\nsystems provide.\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis provides its own core client API for clients to use if\nthey wish to have access to functionality over and above that accessible via\nthe JMS API.\nPlease see Core for using the Core API with Apache ActiveMQ Artemis.\nRESTful API\nREST\napproaches to messaging are showing a lot interest recently.\nIt seems plausible that API standards for cloud computing may converge on a\nREST style set of interfaces and consequently a REST messaging approach is a\nvery strong contender for becoming the de-facto method for messaging\ninteroperability.\nWith a REST approach messaging resources are manipulated as resources defined\nby a URI and typically using a simple set of operations on those resources,\ne.g. PUT, POST, GET etc. REST approaches to messaging often use HTTP as their\nunderlying protocol.\nThe advantage of a REST approach with HTTP is in its simplicity and the fact\nthe internet is already tuned to deal with HTTP optimally.\nPlease see Rest Interface for using Apache ActiveMQ Artemis's\nRESTful interface.\nAMQP\nAMQP is a specification for interoperable\nmessaging. It also defines a wire format, so any AMQP client can work with any\nmessaging system that supports AMQP. AMQP clients are available in many\ndifferent programming languages.\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis implements the AMQP\n1.0\nspecification. Any client that supports the 1.0 specification will be able to\ninteract with Apache ActiveMQ Artemis.\nPlease see AMQP for using AMQP with Apache ActiveMQ Artemis.\nMQTT\nMQTT is a lightweight connectivity protocol.  It is\ndesigned to run in environments where device and networks are constrained.  Out\nof the box Apache ActiveMQ Artemis supports version MQTT 3.1.1.  Any client\nsupporting this version of the protocol will work against Apache ActiveMQ\nArtemis.\nPlease see MQTT for using MQTT with Apache ActiveMQ Artemis.\nSTOMP\nStomp is a very simple text protocol for\ninteroperating with messaging systems. It defines a wire format, so\ntheoretically any Stomp client can work with any messaging system that\nsupports Stomp. Stomp clients are available in many different\nprogramming languages.\nPlease see Stomp for using STOMP with Apache ActiveMQ Artemis.\nOpenWire\nActiveMQ 5.x defines its own wire protocol: OpenWire.  In order to support\nActiveMQ 5.x clients, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis supports OpenWire.  Any ActiveMQ\n5.12.x or higher can be used with Apache ActiveMQ Artemis.\nPlease see OpenWire for using OpenWire with Apache ActiveMQ\nArtemis.\nHigh Availability\nHigh Availability (HA) means that the system should remain operational after\nfailure of one or more of the servers. The degree of support for HA varies\nbetween various messaging systems.\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis provides automatic failover where your sessions are\nautomatically reconnected to the backup server on event of live server failure.\nFor more information on HA, please see High Availability and Failover.\nClusters\nMany messaging systems allow you to create groups of messaging servers called\nclusters. Clusters allow the load of sending and consuming messages to be\nspread over many servers. This allows your system to scale horizontally by\nadding new servers to the cluster.\nDegrees of support for clusters varies between messaging systems, with some\nsystems having fairly basic clusters with the cluster members being hardly\naware of each other.\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis provides very configurable state-of-the-art clustering\nmodel where messages can be intelligently load balanced between the servers in\nthe cluster, according to the number of consumers on each node, and whether\nthey are ready for messages.\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis also has the ability to automatically redistribute\nmessages between nodes of a cluster to prevent starvation on any particular\nnode.\nFor full details on clustering, please see Clusters.\nBridges and routing\nSome messaging systems allow isolated clusters or single nodes to be bridged\ntogether, typically over unreliable connections like a wide area network (WAN),\nor the internet.\nA bridge normally consumes from a queue on one server and forwards messages to\nanother queue on a different server. Bridges cope with unreliable connections,\nautomatically reconnecting when the connections becomes available again.\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis bridges can be configured with filter expressions to\nonly forward certain messages, and transformation can also be hooked in.\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis also allows routing between queues to be configured in\nserver side configuration. This allows complex routing networks to be set up\nforwarding or copying messages from one destination to another, forming a\nglobal network of interconnected brokers.\nFor more information please see Core Bridges and Diverting\nand Splitting Message Flows.\n"},"architecture.html":{"url":"architecture.html","title":"Architecture","keywords":"","body":"Core Architecture\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis core is designed simply as set of Plain Old Java\nObjects (POJOs) - we hope you like its clean-cut design.\nEach Apache ActiveMQ Artemis server has its own ultra high performance\npersistent journal, which it uses for message and other persistence.\nUsing a high performance journal allows outrageous persistence message\nperformance, something not achievable when using a relational database for\npersistence (although JDBC is still an option if necessary).\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis clients, potentially on different physical machines,\ninteract with the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis broker. Apache ActiveMQ Artemis\ncurrently ships two API implementations for messaging at the client side:\n\nCore client API. This is a simple intuitive Java API that is aligned with\nthe Artemis internal Core.  Allowing more control of broker objects (e.g\ndirect creation of addresses and queues).  The Core API also offers a full set\nof messaging functionality without some of the complexities of JMS.\n\nJMS 2.0 client API. The standard JMS API is available at the client side.\n\n\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis also provides different protocol implementations on the\nserver so you can use respective clients for these protocols:\n\nAMQP\nOpenWire\nMQTT\nSTOMP\nHornetQ (for use with HornetQ clients).\nCore (Artemis CORE protocol)\n\nJMS semantics are implemented by a JMS facade layer on the client side.\nThe Apache ActiveMQ Artemis broker does not speak JMS and in fact does not know\nanything about JMS, it is a protocol agnostic messaging server designed to be\nused with multiple different protocols.\nWhen a user uses the JMS API on the client side, all JMS interactions are\ntranslated into operations on the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis core client API\nbefore being transferred over the wire using the core protocol.\nThe broker always just deals with core API interactions.\nA schematic illustrating this relationship is shown in figure 3.1 below:\n\nFigure 3.1 shows two user applications interacting with an Apache ActiveMQ\nArtemis server. User Application 1 is using the JMS API, while User Application\n2 is using the core client API directly.\nYou can see from the diagram that the JMS API is implemented by a thin facade\nlayer on the client side.\nStand-alone Broker\nThe normal stand-alone messaging broker configuration comprises a core\nmessaging broker and a number of protocol managers that provide support for the\nvarious protocol mentioned earlier.\nThe stand-alone broker configuration uses\nAirline for bootstrapping the Broker.\nThe stand-alone broker architecture is shown in figure 3.3 below:\n\nFor more information on server configuration files see Server\nConfiguration\nEmbedded Broker\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis core is designed as a set of simple POJOs so if you\nhave an application that requires messaging functionality internally but you\ndon't want to expose that as an Apache ActiveMQ Artemis broker you can directly\ninstantiate and embed brokers in your own application.\nRead more about embedding Apache ActiveMQ Artemis.\nIntegrated with a Java EE application server\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis provides its own fully functional Java Connector\nArchitecture (JCA) adaptor which enables it to be integrated easily into any\nJava EE compliant application server or servlet engine.\nJava EE application servers provide Message Driven Beans (MDBs), which are a\nspecial type of Enterprise Java Beans (EJBs) that can process messages from\nsources such as JMS systems or mail systems.\nProbably the most common use of an MDB is to consume messages from a JMS\nmessaging system.\nAccording to the Java EE specification, a Java EE application server uses a JCA\nadapter to integrate with a JMS messaging system so it can consume messages for\nMDBs.\nHowever, the JCA adapter is not only used by the Java EE application server for\nconsuming messages via MDBs, it is also used when sending message to the JMS\nmessaging system e.g. from inside an EJB or servlet.\nWhen integrating with a JMS messaging system from inside a Java EE application\nserver it is always recommended that this is done via a JCA adaptor. In fact,\ncommunicating with a JMS messaging system directly, without using JCA would be\nillegal according to the Java EE specification.\nThe application server's JCA service provides extra functionality such as\nconnection pooling and automatic transaction enlistment, which are desirable\nwhen using messaging, say, from inside an EJB. It is possible to talk to a JMS\nmessaging system directly from an EJB, MDB or servlet without going through a\nJCA adapter, but this is not recommended since you will not be able to take\nadvantage of the JCA features, such as caching of JMS sessions, which can\nresult in poor performance.\nFigure 3.2 below shows a Java EE application server integrating with a Apache\nActiveMQ Artemis server via the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis JCA adaptor. Note that\nall communication between EJB sessions or entity beans and Message Driven beans\ngo through the adaptor and not directly to Apache ActiveMQ Artemis.\nThe large arrow with the prohibited sign shows an EJB session bean talking\ndirectly to the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis server. This is not recommended as\nyou'll most likely end up creating a new connection and session every time you\nwant to interact from the EJB, which is an anti-pattern.\n\n"},"using-server.html":{"url":"using-server.html","title":"Using the Server","keywords":"","body":"Using the Server\nThis chapter will familiarise you with how to use the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis\nserver.\nWe'll show where it is, how to start and stop it, and we'll describe the\ndirectory layout and what all the files are and what they do.\nFor the remainder of this chapter when we talk about the Apache ActiveMQ\nArtemis server we mean the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis standalone server, in its\ndefault configuration with a JMS Service enabled.\nThis document will refer to the full path of the directory where the ActiveMQ\ndistribution has been extracted to as ${ARTEMIS_HOME} directory.\nInstallation\nAfter downloading the distribution, the following highlights some important\nfolders on the distribution:\n         |___ bin\n         |\n         |___ examples\n         |      |___ common\n         |      |___ features\n         |      |___ perf\n         |      |___ protocols\n         |\n         |___ lib\n         |      |___ client\n         |\n         |___ schema\n         |\n         |___ web\n                |___ api\n                |___ hacking-guide\n                |___ migration-guide\n                |___ user-manual\n\nbin - binaries and scripts needed to run ActiveMQ Artemis.\n\nexamples - All manner of examples.

It is\nrecommended that you do not create the instance directory under\n${ARTEMIS_HOME}.  This separation is encouraged so that you can more easily\nupgrade when the next version of ActiveMQ Artemis is released.\nOn Unix systems, it is a common convention to store this kind of runtime data\nunder the /var/lib directory.  For example, to create an instance at\n'/var/lib/mybroker', run the following commands in your command line shell:\ncd /var/lib\n${ARTEMIS_HOME}/bin/artemis create mybroker\n\nA broker instance directory will contain the following sub directories:\n\nbin: holds execution scripts associated with this instance.\netc: hold the instance configuration files\ndata: holds the data files used for storing persistent messages\nlog: holds rotating log files\ntmp: holds temporary files that are safe to delete between broker runs\n\nAt this point you may want to adjust the default configuration located in the\netc directory.\nOptions\nThere are several options you can use when creating an instance.\nFor a full list of updated properties always use:\n $./artemis help create\n NAME\n         artemis create - creates a new broker instance\n\n SYNOPSIS\n        artemis create [--addresses ] [--aio] [--allow-anonymous]\n                [--autocreate] [--blocking] [--cluster-password ]\n                [--cluster-user ] [--clustered] [--data ]\n                [--default-port ] [--disable-persistence]\n                [--encoding ] [--etc ] [--failover-on-shutdown] [--force]\n                [--global-max-size ] [--home ] [--host ]\n                [--http-host ] [--http-port ]\n                [--java-options ] [--mapped] [--max-hops ]\n                [--message-load-balancing ] [--name ]\n                [--nio] [--no-amqp-acceptor] [--no-autocreate] [--no-autotune]\n                [--no-fsync] [--no-hornetq-acceptor] [--no-mqtt-acceptor]\n                [--no-stomp-acceptor] [--no-web] [--paging] [--password ]\n                [--ping ] [--port-offset ] [--queues ]\n                [--replicated] [--require-login] [--role ] [--shared-store]\n                [--silent] [--slave] [--ssl-key ]\n                [--ssl-key-password ] [--ssl-trust ]\n                [--ssl-trust-password ] [--use-client-auth]\n                [--user ] [--verbose] [--] \n\n OPTIONS\n         --addresses \n             Comma separated list of addresses\n\n         --aio\n             Sets the journal as asyncio.\n\n         --allow-anonymous\n             Enables anonymous configuration on security, opposite of\n             --require-login (Default: input)\n\n         --autocreate\n             Auto create addresses.

Example:\n/var/lib/mybroker/bin/artemis stop\n\nPlease note that Apache ActiveMQ Artemis requires a Java 7 or later runtime to\nrun.\nBy default the etc/bootstrap.xml configuration is used. The configuration can\nbe changed e.g. by running ./artemis run -- xml:path/to/bootstrap.xml or\nanother config of your choosing.\nEnvironment variables are used to provide ease of changing ports, hosts and\ndata directories used and can be found in etc/artemis.profile on linux and\netc\\artemis.profile.cmd on Windows.\nServer JVM settings\nThe run scripts set some JVM settings for tuning the garbage collection policy\nand heap size. We recommend using a parallel garbage collection algorithm to\nsmooth out latency and minimise large GC pauses.\nBy default Apache ActiveMQ Artemis runs in a maximum of 1GiB of RAM. To\nincrease the memory settings change the -Xms and -Xmx memory settings as\nyou would for any Java program.\nIf you wish to add any more JVM arguments or tune the existing ones, the run\nscripts are the place to do it.\nLibrary Path\nIf you're using the Asynchronous IO Journal on Linux, you need to\nspecify java.library.path as a property on your Java options. This is done\nautomatically in the scripts.\nIf you don't specify java.library.path at your Java options then the JVM will\nuse the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH.\nYou will need to make sure libaio is installed on Linux. For more information\nrefer to the libaio chapter.\nSystem properties\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis can take a system property on the command line for\nconfiguring logging.\nFor more information on configuring logging, please see the section on\nLogging.\nConfiguration files\nThe configuration file used to bootstrap the server (e.g.  bootstrap.xml by\ndefault) references the specific broker configuration files.\n\nbroker.xml. This is the main ActiveMQ configuration file. All the\nparameters in this file are described here\n\nIt is also possible to use system property substitution in all the\nconfiguration files. by replacing a value with the name of a system property.\nHere is an example of this with a connector configuration:\ntcp://${activemq.remoting.netty.host:localhost}:${activemq.remoting.netty.port:61616}\n\nHere you can see we have replaced 2 values with system properties\nactivemq.remoting.netty.host and activemq.remoting.netty.port. These values\nwill be replaced by the value found in the system property if there is one, if\nnot they default back to localhost or 61616 respectively. It is also possible\nto not supply a default. i.e.  ${activemq.remoting.netty.host}, however the\nsystem property must be supplied in that case.\nBootstrap configuration file\nThe stand-alone server is basically a set of POJOs which are instantiated by\nAirline commands.\nThe bootstrap file is very simple. Let's take a look at an example:\n\n\n   \n\n   \n\n   \n       \n       \n       \n   \n\n\n\nserver - Instantiates a core server using the configuration file from the\nconfiguration attribute. This is the main broker POJO necessary to do all\n the real messaging work.\n\njaas-security - Configures JAAS-based security for the server. The\ndomain attribute refers to the relevant login module entry in\nlogin.config. If different behavior is needed then a custom security\nmanager can be configured by replacing jaas-security with\nsecurity-manager. See the \"Custom Security Manager\" section in the\nsecurity chapter for more details.\n\nweb - Configures an embedded Jetty instance to serve web applications like\nthe admin console.\n\n\nBroker configuration file\nThe configuration for the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis core server is contained in\nbroker.xml. This is what the FileConfiguration bean uses to configure the\nmessaging server.\nThere are many attributes which you can configure Apache ActiveMQ Artemis. In\nmost cases the defaults will do fine, in fact every attribute can be defaulted\nwhich means a file with a single empty configuration element is a valid\nconfiguration file. The different configuration will be explained throughout\nthe manual or you can refer to the configuration reference\nhere.\nWindows Server\nOn windows you will have the option to run ActiveMQ Artemis as a service.  Just\nuse the following command to install it:\n $ ./artemis-service.exe install\nThe create process should give you a hint of the available commands available\nfor the artemis-service.exe\nAdding Bootstrap Dependencies\nBootstrap dependencies like logging handlers must be accessible by the log\nmanager at boot time. Package the dependency in a jar and put it on the boot\nclasspath before of log manager jar. This can be done appending the jar at the\nvariable JAVA_ARGS, defined in artemis.profile, with the option -Xbootclasspath/a.\nAdding Runtime Dependencies\nRuntime dependencies like diverts, transformers, broker plugins, JDBC drivers,\npassword decoders, etc. must be accessible by the broker at runtime. Package\nthe dependency in a jar, and put it on the broker's classpath. This can be done\nby placing the jar file in the lib directory of the broker distribution\nitself or in the lib directory of the broker instance. A broker instance does\nnot have a lib directory by default so it may need to be created.  It should\nbe on the \"top\" level with the bin, data, log, etc. directories.\n"},"upgrading.html":{"url":"upgrading.html","title":"Upgrading","keywords":"","body":"Upgrading the Broker\nApache ActiveMQ 5.x (and previous versions) is runnable out of the box by\nexecuting the command: ./bin/activemq run. The ActiveMQ Artemis broker\nfollows a different paradigm where the project distribution serves as the\nbroker \"home\" and one or more broker \"instances\" are created which reference\nthe \"home\" for resources (e.g. jar files) which can be safely shared between\nbroker instances. Therefore, an instance of the broker must be created before\nit can be run. This may seems like an overhead at first glance, but it becomes\nvery practical when updating to a new Artemis version for example.\nTo create an Artemis broker instance navigate into the Artemis home folder and\nrun: ./bin/artemis create /path/to/myBrokerInstance on the command line.\nBecause of this separation it's very easy to upgrade Artemis in most cases.\n\nNote:\nIt's recommended to choose a folder different than the on where Apache\nArtemis was downloaded. This separation allows you run multiple broker\ninstances with the same Artemis \"home\" for example. It also simplifies\nupdating to newer versions of Artemis. \n\nGeneral Upgrade Procedure\nUpgrading may require some specific steps noted in the versions,\nbut the general process is as follows:\n\nNavigate to the etc folder of the broker instance that's being upgraded\nOpen artemis.profile (artemis.profile.cmd on Windows). It contains a\nproperty which is relevant for the upgrade:\nARTEMIS_HOME='/path/to/apache-artemis-version'\n\n\nIf you run Artemis as a service on windows you have to do the following additional steps:\n\nNavigate to the bin folder of the broker instance that's being upgraded\nOpen artemis-service.xml. It contains a property which is relevant for the upgrade:\n\n\n\nThe ARTEMIS_HOME property is used to link the instance with the home.  In\nmost cases the instance can be upgraded to a newer version simply by changing\nthe value of this property to the location of the new broker home. Please refer\nto the aforementioned versions document for additional upgrade\nsteps (if required).\n"},"address-model.html":{"url":"address-model.html","title":"Address Model","keywords":"","body":"Addressing Model\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis has a unique addressing model that is both powerful and\nflexible and that offers great performance. The addressing model comprises\nthree main concepts: addresses, queues, and routing types.\nAddress\nAn address represents a messaging endpoint. Within the configuration, a typical\naddress is given a unique name, 0 or more queues, and a routing type.\nQueue\nA queue is associated with an address. There can be multiple queues per\naddress. Once an incoming message is matched to an address, the message will be\nsent on to one or more of its queues, depending on the routing type configured.\nQueues can be configured to be automatically created and deleted.\nRouting Types\nA routing type determines how messages are sent to the queues associated with\nan address. An Apache ActiveMQ Artemis address can be configured with two\ndifferent routing types.\nTable 1. Routing Types\n\n\n\nIf you want your messages routed to...\nUse this routing type...\n\n\n\n\nA single queue within the matching address, in a point-to-point manner.\nAnycast\n\n\nEvery queue within the matching address, in a publish-subscribe manner.\nMulticast\n\n\n\nNote: It is possible to define more than one routing type per address, but\nthis typically results in an anti-pattern and is therefore not recommended.  If\nan address does use both routing types, however, and the client does not show a\npreference for either one, the broker typically defaults to the anycast routing\ntype.\nThe one exception is when the client uses the MQTT protocol. In that case, the\ndefault routing type is multicast.\nFor additional details about these concepts refer to the core chapter.\nBasic Address Configuration\nThe following examples show how to configure basic point to point and publish\nsubscribe addresses.\nPoint-to-Point Messaging\nPoint-to-point messaging is a common scenario in which a message sent by a\nproducer has only one consumer. AMQP and JMS message producers and consumers\ncan make use of point-to-point messaging queues, for example. Define an anycast\nrouting type for an address so that its queues receive messages in a\npoint-to-point manner.\nWhen a message is received on an address using anycast, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis\nlocates the queue associated with the address and routes the message to it.\nWhen consumers request to consume from the address, the broker locates the\nrelevant queue and associates this queue with the appropriate consumers. If\nmultiple consumers are connected to the same queue, messages are distributed\namongst each consumer equally, providing the consumers are equally able to\nhandle them.\n\nFigure 1. Point to Point Messaging\nUsing the Anycast Routing Type\nOpen the file /etc/broker.xml for editing.\nAdd an address configuration element and its associated queue if they do not\nexist already.\nNote: For normal Point to Point semantics, the queue name MUST match the\naddress name.\n\n   \n      \n         \n      \n   \n\n\nPublish-Subscribe Messaging\nIn a publish-subscribe scenario, messages are sent to every consumer subscribed\nto an address. JMS topics and MQTT subscriptions are two examples of\npublish-subscribe messaging.\nTo configure an address with publish-subscribe semantics, create an address\nwith the multicast routing type.\n\nFigure 2. Publish-Subscribe\nUsing the Multicast Routing Type\nOpen the file /etc/broker.xml for editing.\nAdd an address configuration element with multicast routing type.\n\n   \n      \n   \n\n\nWhen clients connect to an address with the multicast element, a subscription\nqueue for the client will be automatically created for the client. It is also\npossible to pre-configure subscription queues and connect to them directly\nusing the queue's Fully Qualified Queue names.\nOptionally add one or more queue elements to the address and wrap the multicast\nelement around them. This step is typically not needed since the broker will\nautomatically create a queue for each subscription requested by a client.\n\n   \n      \n         \n         \n      \n   \n\n\nFigure 3. Point-to-Point with Two Queues\nPoint-to-Point Address multiple Queues\nIt is actually possible to define more than one queue on an address with an\nanycast routing type. When messages are received on such an address, they are\nfirstly distributed evenly across all the defined queues. Using Fully\nQualified Queue names, clients are able to\nselect the queue that they would like to subscribe to. Should more than one\nconsumer connect directly to a single queue, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis will take\ncare of distributing messages between them, as in the example above.\n\nFigure 3. Point-to-Point with Two Queues\nNote: This is how Apache ActiveMQ Artemis handles load balancing of queues\nacross multiple nodes in a cluster.  Configuring a Point-to-Point Address with\ntwo queues, open the file /etc/broker.xml for editing.\nAdd an address configuration with Anycast routing type element and its\nassociated queues.\n\n   \n      \n         \n         \n      \n   \n\n\nPoint-to-Point and Publish-Subscribe Addresses\nIt is possible to define an address with both point-to-point and\npublish-subscribe semantics enabled. While not typically recommend, this can be\nuseful when you want, for example, a JMS Queue say orders and a JMS Topic named\norders.  The different routing types make the addresses appear to be distinct.\nUsing an example of JMS Clients, the messages sent by a JMS message producer\nwill be routed using the anycast routing type. Messages sent by a JMS topic\nproducer will use the multicast routing type. In addition when a JMS topic\nconsumer attaches, it will be attached to it’s own subscription queue. JMS\nqueue consumer will be attached to the anycast queue.\n\nFigure 4. Point-to-Point and Publish-Subscribe\nNote: The behavior in this scenario is dependent on the protocol being\nused. For JMS there is a clear distinction between topic and queue producers\nand consumers, which make the logic straight forward. Other protocols like AMQP\ndo not make this distinction. A message being sent via AMQP will be routed by\nboth anycast and multicast and consumers will default to anycast. For more\ninformation, please check the behavior of each protocol in the sections on\nprotocols.\nThe XML snippet below is an example of what the configuration for an address\nusing both anycast and multicast would look like in\n/etc/broker.xml. Note that subscription queues are typically\ncreated on demand, so there is no need to list specific queue elements inside\nthe multicast routing type.\n\n   \n      \n         \n      \n      \n   \n\n\nHow to filter messages\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis supports the ability to filter messages using Apache\nArtemis Filter Expressions.\nFilters can be applied in two places, on a queue and on a consumer.\nQueue Filter\nWhen a filter is applied to a queue, messages are filtered before they are sent to\nthe queue.  To add a queue filter use the filter element when configuring a\nqueue.  Open up /etc/broker.xml and add an address with a\nqueue, using the filter element to configure a filter on this queue.\n\n   \n      \n         \n      \n   \n\n\nThe filter defined above ensures that only messages with an attribute\n\"color='red'\" is sent to this queue.\nConsumer Filters\nConsumer filters are applied after messages have reached a queue and are\ndefined using the appropriate client APIs. The following JMS example shows how\nconsumer filters work.\n\nDefine an address with a single queue, with no filter applied.\n\n\n   \n      \n   \n\n\n...\n// Send some messages\nfor (int i = 0; i \nAt this point the queue would have 6 messages: red,green,red,green,red,green\nMessageConsumer redConsumer = redSession.createConsumer(queue, \"color='red'\");\n\nThe redConsumer has a filter that only matches \"red\" messages.  The redConsumer\nwill receive 3 messages.\nred, red, red\nThe resulting queue would now be\ngreen, green, green\nAutomatic Address/Queue Management\nYou can configure Apache ActiveMQ Artemis to automatically create addresses and\nqueues, and then delete them when they are no longer in use. This saves you\nfrom having to preconfigure each address and queue before a client can connect\nto it. Automatic creation and deletion is configured on a per address basis and\nis controlled by following:\n\n\n\nParameter\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nauto-create-addresses\nWhen set to true, the broker will create the address requested by the client if it does not exist already. The default is true.\n\n\nauto-delete-addresses\nWhen set to true, the broker will be delete any auto-created adddress once all of it’s queues have been deleted. The default is true\n\n\ndefault-address-routing-type\nThe routing type to use if the client does not specify one. Possible values are MULTICAST and ANYCAST. See earlier in this chapter for more information about routing types. The default value is MULTICAST.\n\n\n\nAuto Address Creation\n\nEdit the file /etc/broker.xml and add the\nauto-create-addresses element to the address-setting you want the broker\nto automatically create.\n\n(Optional) Add the address-setting if it does not exist. Use the match\nparameter and the wildcard syntax to match more than\none specific address.\n\nSet auto-create-addresses to true\n\n(Optional) Assign MULTICAST or ANYCAST as the default routing type for\nthe address.\n\n\nThe example below configures an address-setting to be automatically created\nby the broker. The default routing type to be used if not specified by the\nclient is MULTICAST. Note that wildcard syntax is used. Any address starting\nwith /news/politics/ will be automatically created by the broker.\n\n  true\n  MULTICAST\n\n\nAuto Address Deletion\n\nEdit the file /etc/broker.xml and add the\nauto-delete-addresses element to the address-setting you want the broker to\nautomatically create.\n\n(Optional) Add the address-setting if it does not exist. Use the match\nparameter and the wildcard syntax to match more than one\nspecific address.\n\nSet auto-delete-addresses to true\n\n\nThe example below configures an address-setting to be automatically deleted\nby the broker. Note that wildcard syntax is used. Any address request by the\nclient that starts with /news/politics/ is configured to be automatically\ndeleted by the broker.\n\n  true\n  MULTICAST\n\n\n\"Fully Qualified\" Queue Names\nInternally the broker maps a client’s request for an address to specific\nqueues. The broker decides on behalf of the client which queues to send\nmessages to or from which queue to receive messages. However, more advanced use\ncases might require that the client specify a queue directly. In these\nsituations the client uses a fully qualified queue name, by specifying both\nthe address name and the queue name, separated by a ::.\nCurrently Artemis supports fully qualified queue names on Core, AMQP, JMS,\nOpenWire, MQTT and STOMP protocols for receiving messages only.\nSpecifying a Fully Qualified Queue Name\nIn this example, the address foo is configured with two queues q1, q2 as shown\nin the configuration below.\n\n   \n      \n         \n         \n      \n   \n\n\nIn the client code, use both the address name and the queue name when\nrequesting a connection from the broker. Remember to use two colons, ::, to\nseparate the names, as in the example Java code below.\nString FQQN = \"foo::q1\";\nQueue q1 session.createQueue(FQQN);\nMessageConsumer consumer = session.createConsumer(q1);\n\nUsing Prefixes to Determine Routing Type\nNormally, if the broker receives a message sent to a particular address, that\nhas both ANYCAST and MULTICAST routing types enable, it will route a copy\nof the message to one of the ANYCAST queues and to all of the\nMULTICAST queues.\nHowever, clients can specify a special prefix when connecting to an address to\nindicate which kind of routing type to use. The prefixes are custom values that\nare designated using the anycastPrefix and multicastPrefix parameters within\nthe URL of an acceptor.\nConfiguring an Anycast Prefix\nIn /etc/broker.xml, add the anycastPrefix to the URL of\nthe desired acceptor. In the example below, the acceptor is configured to use\nanycast:// for the anycastPrefix. Client code can specify anycast://foo/\nif the client needs to send a message to only one of the ANYCAST queues.\ntcp://0.0.0.0:61616?protocols=AMQP;anycastPrefix=anycast://\n\nConfiguring a Multicast Prefix\nIn /etc/broker.xml, add the multicastPrefix to the URL of\nthe desired acceptor. In the example below, the acceptor is configured to use\nmulticast:// for the multicastPrefix. Client code can specify\nmulticast://foo/ if the client needs to send a message to only one of the\nMULTICAST queues.\ntcp://0.0.0.0:61616?protocols=AMQP;multicastPrefix=multicast://\n\nAdvanced Address Configuration\nStatic Subscription Queues\nIn most cases it’s not necessary to statically configure subscription queues.\nThe relevant protocol managers take care of dynamically creating subscription\nqueues when clients request to subscribe to an address.  The type of\nsubscription queue created depends on what properties the client request.  For\nexample, durable, non-shared, shared etc.  Protocol managers use special queue\nnaming conventions to identify which queues belong to which consumers and users\nneed not worry about the details.\nHowever, there are scenarios where a user may want to use broker side\nconfiguration to statically configure a subscription and later connect to that\nqueue directly using a Fully Qualified Queue\nname.  The examples below show how to use broker\nside configuration to statically configure a queue with publish subscribe\nbehavior for shared, non-shared, durable and non-durable subscription behavior.\nShared, Durable Subscription Queue using max-consumers\nThe default behavior for queues is to not limit the number connected queue\nconsumers.  The max-consumers parameter of the queue element can be used to\nlimit the number of connected consumers allowed at any one time.\nOpen the file /etc/broker.xml for editing.\n\n   \n      \n         \n         \n            true\n         \n      \n   \n\n\nNon-shared, Durable Subscription Queue\nThe broker can be configured to prevent more than one consumer from connecting\nto a queue at any one time. The subscriptions to queues configured this way are\ntherefore \"non-shared\".  To do this simply set the max-consumers parameter\nto 1:\n\n   \n      \n         \n         \n            true\n         \n      \n   \n\n\nNon-durable Subscription Queue\nNon-durable subscriptions are again usually managed by the relevant protocol\nmanager, by creating and deleting temporary queues.\nIf a user requires to pre-create a queue that behaves like a non-durable\nsubscription queue the purge-on-no-consumers flag can be enabled on the\nqueue.  When purge-on-no-consumers is set to true.  The queue will not\nstart receiving messages until a consumer is attached.  When the last consumer\nis detached from the queue.  The queue is purged (its messages are removed)\nand will not receive any more messages until a new consumer is attached.\nOpen the file /etc/broker.xml for editing.\n\n   \n      \n         \n      \n   \n\n\nExclusive Consumer Queue\nIf a user requires to statically configure a queue that routes exclusively to\none active consumer the exclusive flag can be enabled on the queue.\nWhen exclusive is set to true the queue will route messages to the a\nsingle active consumer.  When the active consumer that is being routed to is\ndetached from the queue, if another active consumer exist, one will be chosen\nand routing will now be exclusive to it.\nSee Exclusive Queue for further information.\nOpen the file /etc/broker.xml for editing.\n\n   \n      \n         \n      \n   \n\n\nDisabled Queue\nIf a user requires to statically configure a queue and disable routing to it,\nfor example where a queue needs to be defined so a consumer can bind, \nbut you want to disable message routing to it for the time being.\nOr you need to stop message flow to the queue to allow investigation keeping the consumer bound, \nbut dont wish to have further messages routed to the queue to avoid message build up.\nWhen enabled is set to true  the queue will have messages routed to it. (default)\nWhen enabled is set to false  the queue will NOT have messages routed to it.\nOpen the file /etc/broker.xml for editing.\n\n   \n      \n         \n      \n   \n\n\nWarning: Disabling all the queues on an address means that any message sent to that address will be silently dropped.\nTemporary Queues\nFor some protocols and APIs which only support monolithic \"destinations\"\nwithout the address/queue separation (e.g. AMQP, JMS, etc.) temporary queues\nare created by the broker using a UUID (i.e universally unique identifier) as\nthe name for both the address and the queue. Because the name is a UUID it is\nimpossible to create an address-setting for it whose match is anything but\n#.\nTo solve this problem one can specify the temporary-queue-namespace in\nbroker.xml and then create an address-setting whose match value\ncorresponds to the configured temporary-queue-namespace. When the\ntemporary-queue-namespace is set and a temporary queue is created then the\nbroker will prepend the temporary-queue-namespace value along with the\ndelimiter value configured in wildcard-addresses (defaults to .) to the\naddress name and use that to lookup the associated address-setting values.\nHere's a simple example configuration:\ntemp\n\n\n   \n      false\n   \n\n\nUsing this configuration any temporary queue will have metrics disabled.\n\nNote:\nThis setting does not change the actual name of the temporary queue. It\nonly changes the name used to lookup the address-settings.\n\nProtocol Managers\nA \"protocol manager\" maps protocol-specific concepts down to the core\naddressing model (using addresses, queues and routing types). For example, when\na client sends a MQTT subscription packet with the addresses: \n/house/room1/lights\n/house/room2/lights\nThe MQTT protocol manager understands that the two addresses require\nMULTICAST semantics. The protocol manager will therefore first look to ensure\nthat MULTICAST is enabled for both addresses. If not, it will attempt to\ndynamically create them. If successful, the protocol manager will then create\nspecial subscription queues with special names, for each subscription requested\nby the client.\nThe special name allows the protocol manager to quickly identify the required\nclient subscription queues should the client disconnect and reconnect at a\nlater date.  If the subscription is temporary the protocol manager will delete\nthe queue once the client disconnects.\nWhen a client requests to subscribe to a point to point address.  The protocol\nmanager will look up the queue associated with the point to point address.\nThis queue should have the same name as the addresss.\nNote: If the queue is auto created, it will be auto deleted once there are\nno consumers and no messages in it.  For more information on auto create see\nthe next section Configuring Addresses and Queues via Address\nSettings\nConfiguring Addresses and Queues via Address Settings\nThere are some attributes that are defined against an address wildcard rather\nthan a specific address/queue. Here an example of an address-setting entry\nthat would be found in the broker.xml file.\n\n   \n      DLA\n      false\n      DLQ.\n      \n      ExpiryQueue\n      false\n      EXP.\n      \n      123\n      5000\n      1.0\n      0.0\n      10000\n      3\n      100000\n      -1\n      20000\n      \n      PAGE\n      \n      true \n      false\n      false\n      false\n      0\n      -1\n      0\n      true\n      -1\n      NOTIFY\n      5\n      true \n      true \n      true \n      true \n      true\n      true\n      false\n      0\n      0\n      OFF\n      true\n      true\n      0\n      OFF\n      200\n      false\n      -1\n      \n      \n      -1\n      0\n      true\n   \n\n\nThe idea with address settings, is you can provide a block of settings which\nwill be applied against any addresses that match the string in the match\nattribute. In the above example the settings would only be applied to the\naddress \"order.foo\" address but you can also use\nwildcards to apply settings.\nFor example, if you used the match string queue.# the settings would be\napplied to all addresses which start with queue.\nThe meaning of the specific settings are explained fully throughout the user\nmanual, however here is a brief description with a link to the appropriate\nchapter if available.\ndead-letter-address is the address to which messages are sent when they\nexceed max-delivery-attempts.

This attribute can have one of the following values:\nPAGE, DROP, FAIL or BLOCK and determines what happens when an address\nwhere max-size-bytes is specified becomes full. The default value is PAGE.\nIf the value is PAGE then further messages will be paged to disk. If the\nvalue is DROP then further messages will be silently dropped. If the value is\nFAIL then further messages will be dropped and an exception will be thrown on\nthe client-side. If the value is BLOCK then client message producers will\nblock when they try and send further messages.

If a message is sent to an address, but the server\ndoes not route it to any queues (e.g. there might be no queues bound to that\naddress, or none of the queues have filters that match) then normally that\nmessage would be discarded. However, if this parameter is true then such a\nmessage will instead be sent to the dead-letter-address (DLA) for that\naddress, if it exists.\nslow-consumer-threshold.

By default there are acceptor elements configured to accept\nAMQP connections on ports 61616 and 5672.\nSee the general Protocols and Interoperability\nchapter for details on configuring an acceptor for AMQP.\nYou can use any AMQP 1.0 compatible clients.\nA short list includes:\n\nqpid clients\n.NET Clients\nJavascript NodeJS\nJava Script RHEA\n... and many others.\n\nExamples\nWe have a few examples as part of the Artemis distribution:\n\n.NET: \n./examples/protocols/amqp/dotnet\n\n\nProtonCPP\n./examples/protocols/amqp/proton-cpp\n./examples/protocols/amqp/proton-clustered-cpp\n\n\nRuby\n./examples/protocols/amqp/proton-ruby\n\n\nJava (Using the qpid JMS Client)\n./examples/protocols/amqp/queue\n\n\nInterceptors\n./examples/features/standard/interceptor-amqp\n./examples/features/standard/broker-plugin\n\n\n\nMessage Conversions\nThe broker will not perform any message conversion to any other protocols when\nsending AMQP and receiving AMQP.\nHowever if you intend your message to be received by an AMQP JMS Client, you\nmust follow the JMS Mapping\nConventions.\nIf you send a body type that is not recognized by this specification the\nconversion between AMQP and any other protocol will make it a Binary Message.\nMake sure you follow these conventions if you intend to cross protocols or\nlanguages.  Especially on the message body.\nA compatibility setting allows aligning the naming convention of AMQP queues\n(JMS Durable and Shared Subscriptions) with CORE. For backwards compatibility\nreasons, you need to explicitly enable this via broker configuration:\n\namqp-use-core-subscription-naming\ntrue - use queue naming convention that is aligned with CORE.\nfalse (default) - use older naming convention.   \n\n\n\nIntercepting and changing messages\nWe don't recommend changing messages at the server's side for a few reasons:\n\nAMQP messages are meant to be immutable\nThe message won't be the original message the user sent\nAMQP has the possibility of signing messages. The signature would be broken.\nFor performance reasons. We try not to re-encode (or even decode) messages.\n\nIf regardless these recommendations you still need and want to intercept and\nchange AMQP messages, look at the aforementioned interceptor examples.\nAMQP and security\nThe Apache ActiveMQ Artemis Server accepts the PLAIN, ANONYMOUS, and GSSAPI\nSASL mechanism. These are implemented on the broker's security\ninfrastructure.\nAMQP and destinations\nIf an AMQP Link is dynamic then a temporary queue will be created and either\nthe remote source or remote target address will be set to the name of the\ntemporary queue. If the Link is not dynamic then the address of the remote \ntarget or source will be used for the queue. In case it does not exist, \nit will be auto-created if the settings allow.\nAMQP and Multicast Addresses (Topics)\nAlthough AMQP has no notion of \"topics\" it is still possible to treat AMQP\nconsumers or receivers as subscriptions rather than just consumers on a queue.\nBy default any receiving link that attaches to an address that has only\nmulticast enabled will be treated as a subscription and a corresponding\nsubscription queue will be created. If the Terminus Durability is either\nUNSETTLED_STATE or CONFIGURATION then the queue will be made durable\n(similar to a JMS durable subscription) and given a name made up from the\ncontainer id and the link name, something like my-container-id:my-link-name.\nIf the Terminus Durability is configured as NONE then a volatile multicast\nqueue will be created.\nAMQP and Coordinations - Handling Transactions\nAn AMQP links target can also be a Coordinator. A Coordinator is used to handle\ntransactions. If a coordinator is used then the underlying server session will\nbe transacted and will be either rolled back or committed via the coordinator.\n\nNote:\nAMQP allows the use of multiple transactions per session,\namqp:multi-txns-per-ssn, however in this version of Apache ActiveMQ Artemis\nwill only support single transactions per session.\n\nAMQP scheduling message delivery\nAn AMQP message can provide scheduling information that controls the time in\nthe future when the message will be delivered at the earliest.  This\ninformation is provided by adding a message annotation to the sent message.\nThere are two different message annotations that can be used to schedule a\nmessage for later delivery:\n\nx-opt-delivery-time\nThe specified value must be a positive long corresponding to the time the\nmessage should be made available for delivery (in milliseconds).\n\nx-opt-delivery-delay\nThe specified value must be a positive long corresponding to the amount of\nmilliseconds after the broker receives the given message before it should be\nmade available for delivery.\n\n\nIf both annotations are present in the same message then the broker will prefer\nthe more specific x-opt-delivery-time value.\nDLQ and Expiry transfer\nAMQP Messages will be copied before transferred to a DLQ or ExpiryQueue and will receive properties and annotations during this process.\nThe broker also keeps an internal only property (called extra property) that is not exposed to the clients, and those will also be filled during this process.\nHere is a list of Annotations and Property names AMQP Messages will receive when transferred:\n\n\n\nAnnotation name\nInternal Property Name\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nx-opt-ORIG-MESSAGE-ID\n_AMQ_ORIG_MESSAGE_ID\nThe original message ID before the transfer\n\n\nx-opt-ACTUAL-EXPIRY\n_AMQ_ACTUAL_EXPIRY\nWhen the expiry took place. Milliseconds since epoch times\n\n\nx-opt-ORIG-QUEUE\n_AMQ_ORIG_QUEUE\nThe original queue name before the transfer\n\n\nx-opt-ORIG-ADDRESS\n_AMQ_ORIG_ADDRESS\nThe original address name before the transfer\n\n\n\nFiltering on Message Annotations\nIt is possible to filter on messaging annotations if you use the prefix \"m.\" before the annotation name.\nFor example if you want to filter messages sent to a specific destination, you could create your filter accordingly to this:\nConnectionFactory factory = new JmsConnectionFactory(\"amqp://localhost:5672\");\nConnection connection = factory.createConnection();\nSession session = connection.createSession(false, Session.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE);\nconnection.start();\njavax.jms.Queue queue = session.createQueue(\"my-DLQ\");\nMessageConsumer consumer = session.createConsumer(queue, \"\\\"m.x-opt-ORIG-ADDRESS\\\"='ORIGINAL_PLACE'\");\nMessage message = consumer.receive();\n\nThe broker will set internal properties. If you intend to filter after DLQ or Expiry you may choose the internal property names:\n// Replace the consumer creation on the previous example:\nMessageConsumer consumer = session.createConsumer(queue, \"_AMQ_ORIG_ADDRESS='ORIGINAL_PLACE'\");\n\nConfiguring AMQP Idle Timeout\nIt is possible to configure the AMQP Server's IDLE Timeout by setting the property amqpIdleTimeout in milliseconds on the acceptor.\nThis will make the server to send an AMQP frame open to the client, with your configured timeout / 2.\nSo, if you configured your AMQP Idle Timeout to be 60000, the server will tell the client to send frames every 30,000 milliseconds.\n.... ;amqpIdleTimeout=; ..... \n\nDisabling Keep alive checks\nif you set amqpIdleTimeout=0 that will tell clients to not sending keep alive packets towards the server. On this case\nyou will rely on TCP to determine when the socket needs to be closed.\n.... ;amqpIdleTimeout=0; ..... \n\nThis contains a real example for configuring amqpIdleTimeout:\ntcp://0.0.0.0:5672?amqpIdleTimeout=0;tcpSendBufferSize=1048576;tcpReceiveBufferSize=1048576;protocols=AMQP;useEpoll=true;amqpCredits=1000;amqpMinCredits=300;directDeliver=false;batchDelay=10\n\nWeb Sockets\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis also supports AMQP over Web\nSockets.  Modern web\nbrowsers which support Web Sockets can send and receive AMQP messages.\nAMQP over Web Sockets is supported via a normal AMQP acceptor:\ntcp://localhost:5672?protocols=AMQP\n\nWith this configuration, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis will accept AMQP connections\nover Web Sockets on the port 5672. Web browsers can then connect to\nws://:5672 using a Web Socket to send and receive AMQP messages.\n"},"amqp-broker-connections.html":{"url":"amqp-broker-connections.html","title":"Broker Connections","keywords":"","body":"Broker Connections\nInstead of waiting for clients to connect, a broker can initiate a connection to another endpoint on a specific protocol.\nCurrently, this feature supports only the AMQP protocol. However, in the future, it might be expanded to other protocols.\nYou configure broker connections using a  XML element in the broker.xml configuration file.\n\n    ...\n\n\nAMQP Server Connections\nAn ActiveMQ Artemis broker can initiate connections using the AMQP protocol. This means that the broker can connect to another AMQP server (not necessarily ActiveMQ Artemis) and create elements on that connection.\nTo define an AMQP broker connection, add an  element within the  element in the broker.xml configuration file. For example:\n\n    \n         ...\n    \n\n\n\nuri: tcp://host:myport (this is a required argument)\nname: Name of the connection used for management purposes\nuser: User name with which to connect to the endpoint (this is an optional argument)\npassword: Password with which to connect to the endpoint (this is an optional argument)\nretry-interval: Time, in milliseconds to wait before retrying a connection after an error. The default value is 5000.\nreconnect-attempts: default is -1 meaning infinite\nauto-start : Should the broker connection start automatically with the broker. Default is true. If false you need to call a management operation to start it.\n\nNotice: If you disable auto-start on the broker connection, the start of the broker connection will only happen after the management method startBrokerConnection(connectionName) is called on the ServerController.\nImportant: The target endpoint needs permission for all operations that you configure. Therefore, If you are using a security manager, ensure that you perform the configured operations as a user with sufficient permissions.\nAMQP Server Connection Operations\nThe following types of operations are supported on a AMQP server connection:\n\nSenders\nMessages received on specific queues are transferred to another endpoint\n\n\nReceivers\nThe broker pulls messages from another endpoint\n\n\nPeers\nThe broker creates both senders and receivers on another endpoint that knows how to handle them. Currently, this is implemented by Apache Qpid Dispatch.\n\n\nMirrors\nThe broker uses an AMQP connection to another broker and duplicate messages and sends acknowledgements over the wire.\n\n\n\nSenders and Receivers\nIt is possible to connect an ActiveMQ Artemis broker to another AMQP endpoint simply by creating a sender or receiver broker connection element.\nFor a sender, the broker creates a message consumer on a queue that sends messages to another AMQP endpoint.\nFor a receiver, the broker creates a message producer on an address that receives messages from another AMQP endpoint.\nBoth elements work like a message bridge. However, there is no additional overhead required to process messages. Senders and receivers behave just like any other consumer or producer in ActiveMQ Artemis.\nYou can configure senders or receivers for specific queues. You can also match senders and receivers to specific addresses or sets of addresses, using wildcard expressions. When configuring a sender or receiver, you can set the following properties:\n\naddress-match: Match the sender or receiver to a specific address or set of addresses, using a wildcard expression\nqueue-name: Configure the sender or receiver for a specific queue\n\nSome examples are shown below.\nUsing address expressions:\n\n    \n        \n        \n        \n    \n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n\n\nUsing queue names:\n\n    \n        \n        \n    \n\n\n\n     \n        \n           \n        \n     \n     \n        \n           \n        \n     \n\n\nImportant: You can match a receiver only to a local queue that already exists. Therefore, if you are using receivers, make sure that you pre-create the queue locally. Otherwise, the broker cannot match the remote queues and addresses.\nImportant: Do not create a sender and a receiver to the same destination. This creates an infinite loop of sends and receives.\nPeers\nThe broker can be configured as a peer which connects to the Apache Qpid Dispatch Router and instructs it the broker it will act as a store-and-forward queue for a given AMQP waypoint address configured on the router. In this scenario, clients connect to a router to send and receive messages using a waypointed address, and the router routes these messages to or from the queue on the broker.\nThe peer configuration causes ActiveMQ Artemis to create a sender and receiver pair for each destination matched in the broker-connection configuration, with these carrying special configuration to let Qpid Dispatch know to collaborate with the broker. This replaces the traditional need of a router-initiated connection and auto-links.\nYou can experiment with advanced networking scenarios with Qpid Dispatch Router and get a lot of benefit from the AMQP protocol and its ecosystem.\nWith a peer configuration, you have the same properties that you have on a sender and receiver. For example, a configuration where queues with names beginning \"queue.\" act as storage for the matching router waypoint address would be:\n\n    \n       \n    \n\n\n\n     \n        \n           \n        \n     \n     \n     \n        \n     \n    \n\n\nThere must be a matching address waypoint configuration on the router, instructing it that the particular router addresses the broker attaches to should be treated as waypoints. For example, a similar prefix- based router address configuration would be:\naddress {\n    prefix: queue\n    waypoint: yes\n}\nFor more information refer to the \"brokered messaging\" documentation for Apache Qpid Dispatch Router.\nImportant: Do not use this feature to connect to another broker, otherwise any message sent will be immediately ready to consume creating an infinite echo of sends and receives.\nImportant: You do not need to configure the router with a connector or auto-links to communicate with the broker. The brokers peer configuration replaces these aspects of the router waypoint usage.\nAddress Consideration\nIt is highly recommended that you keep address name and queue name the same, as when you use a queue with its distinct name (as in the following example), senders and receivers will always use the address name when creating the remote endpoint.\n\n    \n       \n    \n\n\n     \n        \n           \n        \n     \n\n\nIn the above example the broker connection would create an AMQP sender towards \"queues.A\". \nImportant: To avoid confusion it is recommended that you keep the address name and queue name the same.\nMirror\nThe mirror option on the broker connection can capture events from the broker and pass them over the wire to another broker. This enables you to capture multiple asynchronous replicas. The following types of events are captured:\n\nMessage routing\nMessage acknowledgement\nQueue and address creation\nqueue and address deletion\n\nWhen you configure a mirror, these events are captured from the broker, stored on a local queue, and later forwarded to a target destination on another ActiveMQ Artemis broker.\nTo configure a mirror, you add a  element within the  element.\nThe local queue is called source-mirror-address\nYou can specify the following optional arguments.\n\nqueue-removal: Specifies whether a queue- or address-removal event is sent. The default value is true.\nmessage-acknowledgements: Specifies whether message acknowledgements are sent. The default value is true.\nqueue-creation: Specifies whether a queue- or address-creation event is sent. The default value is true.\nsource-mirror-address: By default, the mirror creates a non-durable temporary queue to store messages before they are sent to the other broker. If you define a name value for this property, an ANYCAST durable queue and address is created with the specified name.\n\nAn example of a mirror configuration is shown below:\n\n    \n            \n    \n\n\nImportant: A broker can mirror to multiple replicas (1 to many). However a replica broker can only have a single mirror source. Make sure you do not mirror multiple source brokers to a single replica broker.\nPre Existing Messages\nThe broker will not send pre existing messages through the mirror. So, If you add mirror to your configuration and the journal had pre existing messages these messages will not be sent. \nBroker Connection Stop and Disconnect\nOnce you start the broker connection with a mirror the mirror events will always be sent to the intermediate queue configured at the source-mirror-address.\nIt is possible to stop the broker connection with the operation stopBrokerConnection(connectionName) on the ServerControl, but it is only effective to disconnect the brokers, while the mirror events are always captured.\nDisaster & Recovery Considerations\nAs you use the mirror option to replicate data across datacenters, you have to take a few considerations:\n\nCurrently we don't support quorums for activating the replica, so you have to manually control when your clients connect to the replica site.\nMake sure the replica site is passive. Having producers and consumers connected into both sites would be messy and could lead you to data integrity issues.\nYou can disable auto-start on the acceptor your clients use to connect, and only enable it after a disaster has occurred.\n\n\nOnly the queues and addresses are mirrored. Consumer states will have to be reapplied on the replica when the clients reconnects (that applies to message groups, exclusive consumers or anything related to clients)\nMake sure your configuration options are copied over, including Diverts, security, last value queues, address settings and other configuration options.\nHave a way back route after a disaster.\nYou can have a disabled broker connection to be enabled after the disaster.\n\n\n\nMirror example with Failback\nOn this example lets play with two brokers:\n\nsourceBroker\nreplicaBroker\n\nAdd this configuration on sourceBroker:\n\n    \n            \n    \n\n\nOn the replicaBroker, add a disabled broker connection for failing back after a disaster, and also set the acceptors with autoStart=false\n\n\n     \n     tcp://0.0.0.0:61616?autoStart=false;tcpSendBufferSize=1048576;tcpReceiveBufferSize=1048576;amqpMinLargeMessageSize=102400;protocols=CORE,AMQP,STOMP,HORNETQ,MQTT,OPENWIRE;useEpoll=true;amqpCredits=1000;amqpLowCredits=300;amqpDuplicateDetection=true;autoStart=false\n     \n     tcp://0.0.0.0:6700?autoStart=true;tcpSendBufferSize=1048576;tcpReceiveBufferSize=1048576;protocols=AMQP;useEpoll=true;amqpCredits=1000;amqpLowCredits=300;amqpMinLargeMessageSize=102400;amqpDuplicateDetection=true;autoStart=false\n\n\n    \n            \n    \n\n\nAfter a failure has occurred, you can use a management operation start on the acceptor:\n\nAcceptorControl.start();\n\nAnd you can call startBrokerConnection to enable the failback towards the live site:\n\nActiveMQServerControl.startBrokerConnection(\"failbackBroker\")\n\n"},"mqtt.html":{"url":"mqtt.html","title":"MQTT","keywords":"","body":"MQTT\nMQTT is a light weight, client to server, publish / subscribe messaging\nprotocol.  MQTT has been specifically designed to reduce transport overhead\n(and thus network traffic) and code footprint on client devices.  For this\nreason MQTT is ideally suited to constrained devices such as sensors and\nactuators and is quickly becoming the defacto standard communication protocol\nfor IoT.\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis supports MQTT v3.1.1 (and also the older v3.1 code\nmessage format). By default there are acceptor elements configured to accept\nMQTT connections on ports 61616 and 1883.\nSee the general Protocols and Interoperability\nchapter for details on configuring an acceptor for MQTT.\nThe best source of information on the MQTT protocol is in the 3.1.1\nspecification.\nRefer to the MQTT examples for a look at some of this functionality in action.\nMQTT Quality of Service\nMQTT offers 3 quality of service levels.\nEach message (or topic subscription) can define a quality of service that is\nassociated with it.  The quality of service level defined on a topic is the\nmaximum level a client is willing to accept.  The quality of service level on a\nmessage is the desired quality of service level for this message.  The broker\nwill attempt to deliver messages to subscribers at the highest quality of\nservice level based on what is defined on the message and topic subscription.\nEach quality of service level offers a level of guarantee by which a message is\nsent or received:\n\nQoS 0: AT MOST ONCE\nGuarantees that a particular message is only ever received by the subscriber\na maximum of one time. This does mean that the message may never arrive.  The\nsender and the receiver will attempt to deliver the message, but if something\nfails and the message does not reach its destination (say due to a network\nconnection) the message may be lost. This QoS has the least network traffic\noverhead and the least burden on the client and the broker and is often useful\nfor telemetry data where it doesn't matter if some of the data is lost.\n\nQoS 1: AT LEAST ONCE\nGuarantees that a message will reach its intended recipient one or more\ntimes.  The sender will continue to send the message until it receives an\nacknowledgment from the recipient, confirming it has received the message. The\nresult of this QoS is that the recipient may receive the message multiple\ntimes, and also increases the network overhead than QoS 0, (due to acks).  In\naddition more burden is placed on the sender as it needs to store the message\nand retry should it fail to receive an ack in a reasonable time.\n\nQoS 2: EXACTLY ONCE\nThe most costly of the QoS (in terms of network traffic and burden on sender\nand receiver) this QoS will ensure that the message is received by a recipient\nexactly one time.  This ensures that the receiver never gets any duplicate\ncopies of the message and will eventually get it, but at the extra cost of\nnetwork overhead and complexity required on the sender and receiver.\n\n\nMQTT Retain Messages\nMQTT has an interesting feature in which messages can be \"retained\" for a\nparticular address.  This means that once a retain message has been sent to an\naddress, any new subscribers to that address will receive the last sent retain\nmessage before any others messages, this happens even if the retained message\nwas sent before a client has connected or subscribed.  An example of where this\nfeature might be useful is in environments such as IoT where devices need to\nquickly get the current state of a system when they are on boarded into a\nsystem.\nWill Messages\nA will message can be sent when a client initially connects to a broker.\nClients are able to set a \"will message\" as part of the connect packet.  If the\nclient abnormally disconnects, say due to a device or network failure the\nbroker will proceed to publish the will message to the specified address (as\ndefined also in the connect packet). Other subscribers to the will topic will\nreceive the will message and can react accordingly. This feature can be useful\nin an IoT style scenario to detect errors across a potentially large scale\ndeployment of devices.\nDebug Logging\nDetailed protocol logging (e.g. packets in/out) can be activated via the\nfollowing steps:\n\nOpen /etc/logging.properties\n\nAdd org.apache.activemq.artemis.core.protocol.mqtt to the loggers list.\n\nAdd this line to enable TRACE logging for this new logger: \nlogger.org.apache.activemq.artemis.core.protocol.mqtt.level=TRACE\n\nEnsure the level for the handler you want to log the message doesn't \nblock the TRACE logging. For example, modify the level of the CONSOLE \nhandler like so: handler.CONSOLE.level=TRACE.\n\n\nThe MQTT specification doesn't dictate the format of the payloads which clients\npublish. As far as the broker is concerned a payload is just just an array of\nbytes. However, to facilitate logging the broker will encode the payloads as\nUTF-8 strings and print them up to 256 characters. Payload logging is limited\nto avoid filling the logs with potentially hundreds of megabytes of unhelpful\ninformation.\nWild card subscriptions\nMQTT addresses are hierarchical much like a file system, and they use a special\ncharacter (i.e. / by default) to separate hierarchical levels. Subscribers\nare able to subscribe to specific topics or to whole branches of a hierarchy.\nTo subscribe to branches of an address hierarchy a subscriber can use wild\ncards. These wild cards (including the aforementioned separator) are\nconfigurable. See the Wildcard\nSyntax chapter for details about\nhow to configure custom wild cards.\nThere are 2 types of wild cards in MQTT:\n\nMulti level (# by default)\nAdding this wild card to an address would match all branches of the address\nhierarchy under a specified node.  For example: /uk/#  Would match\n/uk/cities, /uk/cities/newcastle and also /uk/rivers/tyne. Subscribing to\nan address # would result in subscribing to all topics in the broker.  This\ncan be useful, but should be done so with care since it has significant\nperformance implications.\n\nSingle level (+ by default)\nMatches a single level in the address hierarchy. For example /uk/+/stores\nwould match /uk/newcastle/stores but not /uk/cities/newcastle/stores.\n\n\nWeb Sockets\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis also supports MQTT over Web\nSockets.  Modern web\nbrowsers which support Web Sockets can send and receive MQTT messages.\nMQTT over Web Sockets is supported via a normal MQTT acceptor:\ntcp://localhost:1883?protocols=MQTT\n\nWith this configuration, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis will accept MQTT connections\nover Web Sockets on the port 1883. Web browsers can then connect to\nws://:1883 using a Web Socket to send and receive MQTT messages.\n"},"stomp.html":{"url":"stomp.html","title":"STOMP","keywords":"","body":"STOMP\nSTOMP is a text-orientated wire protocol that\nallows STOMP clients to communicate with STOMP Brokers. Apache ActiveMQ Artemis\nsupports STOMP 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2.\nSTOMP clients are available for several languages and platforms making it a\ngood choice for interoperability.\nBy default there are acceptor elements configured to accept STOMP connections\non ports 61616 and 61613.\nSee the general Protocols and Interoperability\nchapter for details on configuring an acceptor for STOMP.\nRefer to the STOMP examples for a look at some of this functionality in action.\nLimitations\nThe STOMP specification identifies transactional acknowledgements as an\noptional feature. Support for transactional acknowledgements is not implemented\nin Apache ActiveMQ Artemis. The ACK frame can not be part of a transaction.\nIt will be ignored if its transaction header is set.\nVirtual Hosting\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis currently doesn't support virtual hosting, which means\nthe host header in CONNECT frame will be ignored.\nMapping STOMP destinations to addresses and queues\nSTOMP clients deals with destinations when sending messages and subscribing.\nDestination names are simply strings which are mapped to some form of\ndestination on the server - how the server translates these is left to the\nserver implementation.\nIn Apache ActiveMQ Artemis, these destinations are mapped to addresses and\nqueues depending on the operation being done and the desired semantics (e.g.\nanycast or multicast).\nLogging\nIncoming and outgoing STOMP frames can be logged by enabling DEBUG for\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.core.protocol.stomp.StompConnection. This can be\nextremely useful for debugging or simply monitoring client activity. Along with\nthe STOMP frame itself the remote IP address of the client is logged as well as\nthe internal connection ID so that frames from the same client can be correlated.\nRouting Semantics\nThe STOMP specification is intentionally ambiguous about message routing\nsemantics. When providing an overview of the protocol the STOMP 1.2 specification\nsays:\nA STOMP server is modelled as a set of destinations to which messages can be sent.\nThe STOMP protocol treats destinations as opaque string and their syntax is\nserver implementation specific. Additionally STOMP does not define what the\ndelivery semantics of destinations should be. The delivery, or\n\"message exchange\", semantics of destinations can vary from server to server and\neven from destination to destination. This allows servers to be creative with the\nsemantics that they can support with STOMP.\nTherefore, there are a handful of different ways to specify which semantics are\ndesired both on the client-side and broker-side.\nConfiguring Routing Semantics from the Client Side\nSending\nWhen a STOMP client sends a message (using a SEND frame), the protocol\nmanager looks at the destination-type header to determine where to route\nit and potentially how to create the address and/or queue to which it is\nbeing sent. Valid values are ANYCAST and MULTICAST (case sensitive).\nIf no indication of routing type is supplied (either by the client or the\nbroker) then the default defined in the corresponding\ndefault-address-routing-type & default-queue-routing-type\naddress-settings will be used as necessary.\nThe destination header maps to an address of the same name if MULTICAST is\nused and additionally to a queue of the same name if ANYCAST is used.\nSubscribing\nWhen a STOMP client subscribes to a destination (using a SUBSCRIBE frame),\nthe protocol manager looks at the subscription-type header frame to determine\nwhat subscription semantics to use and potentially how to create the address\nand/or queue for the subscription. If no indication of routing type is\nsupplied (either by the client or the broker) then the default defined in the\ncorresponding default-address-routing-type & default-queue-routing-type\naddress-settings will be used as necessary.\nThe destination header maps to an address of the same name if MULTICAST is\nused and additionally to a queue of the same name if ANYCAST is used.\nConfiguring Routing Semantics from the Broker side\nOn the broker-side there are two main options for specifying routing semantics -\nprefixes and address settings\nPrefixes\nUsing prefixes involves specifying the anycastPrefix and/or the\nmulticastPrefix on the acceptor which the STOMP client is using. For the STOMP\nuse-case these prefixes tell the broker that destinations using them should be\ntreated as anycast or multicast. For example, if the acceptor has\nanycastPrefix=queue/ then when a STOMP client sends a message to\ndestination:queue/foo the broker will auto-create the address foo and queue\nfoo appropriately as anycast and the message will be placed in that queue.\nAdditionally, if the acceptor has multicastPrefix=topic/ then when a STOMP\nclient sends a message to destination:topic/bar the broker will auto-create\nthe address bar as multicast, but it won't create a queue since multicast\n(i.e. pub/sub) semantics require a client to explicitly create a subscription\nto receive those messages.\nNote: The anycastPrefix and/or multicastPrefix on the acceptor will be\nstripped from the destination value.\nAddress Settings\nUsing address settings involves defining address-setting elements whose match\ncorresponds with the destination names the clients will use along with the proper\ndelimiter to enabled matching. For example, broker.xml could use the following:\n\n   \n      ANYCAST\n      ANYCAST\n   \n   \n      MULTICAST\n      MULTICAST\n   \n\n\n   /\n\n\nThen if a STOMP client sends a message to destination:queue/foo the broker will\nauto-create the address queue/foo and queue queue/foo appropriately as\nanycast and the message will be placed in that queue. Additionally, if a STOMP\nclient sends a message to destination:topic/bar the broker will auto-create the\naddress topic/bar as multicast, but it won't create a queue as previously\nexplained.\nSTOMP heart-beating and connection-ttl\nWell behaved STOMP clients will always send a DISCONNECT frame before closing\ntheir connections. In this case the server will clear up any server side\nresources such as sessions and consumers synchronously. However if STOMP\nclients exit without sending a DISCONNECT frame or if they crash the server\nwill have no way of knowing immediately whether the client is still alive or\nnot. STOMP connections therefore default to a connection-ttl value of 1\nminute (see chapter on connection-ttl for more\ninformation. This value can be overridden using the connection-ttl-override\nproperty or if you need a specific connectionTtl for your stomp connections\nwithout affecting the broker-wide connection-ttl-override setting, you can\nconfigure your stomp acceptor with the connectionTtl property, which is used\nto set the ttl for connections that are created from that acceptor. For\nexample:\ntcp://localhost:61613?protocols=STOMP;connectionTtl=20000\n\nThe above configuration will make sure that any STOMP connection that is\ncreated from that acceptor and does not include a heart-beat header or\ndisables client-to-server heart-beats by specifying a 0 value will have its\nconnection-ttl set to 20 seconds. The connectionTtl set on an acceptor will\ntake precedence over connection-ttl-override. The default connectionTtl is\n60,000 milliseconds.\nSince STOMP 1.0 does not support heart-beating then all connections from STOMP\n1.0 clients will have a connection TTL imposed upon them by the broker based on\nthe aforementioned configuration options. Likewise, any STOMP 1.1 or 1.2\nclients that don't specify a heart-beat header or disable client-to-server\nheart-beating (e.g. by sending 0,X in the heart-beat header) will have a\nconnection TTL imposed upon them by the broker.\nFor STOMP 1.1 and 1.2 clients which send a non-zero client-to-server\nheart-beat header value then their connection TTL will be set accordingly.\nHowever, the broker will not strictly set the connection TTL to the same value\nas the specified in the heart-beat since even small network delays could then\ncause spurious disconnects. Instead, the client-to-server value in the\nheart-beat will be multiplied by the heartBeatToConnectionTtlModifier\nspecified on the acceptor. The heartBeatToConnectionTtlModifier is a decimal\nvalue that defaults to 2.0 so for example, if a client sends a heart-beat\nheader of 1000,0 the the connection TTL will be set to 2000 so that the\ndata or ping frames sent every 1000 milliseconds will have a sufficient cushion\nso as not to be considered late and trigger a disconnect. This is also in\naccordance with the STOMP 1.1 and 1.2 specifications which both state, \"because\nof timing inaccuracies, the receiver SHOULD be tolerant and take into account\nan error margin.\"\nThe minimum and maximum connection TTL allowed can also be specified on the\nacceptor via the connectionTtlMin and connectionTtlMax properties\nrespectively. The default connectionTtlMin is 1000 and the default\nconnectionTtlMax is Java's Long.MAX_VALUE meaning there essentially is no\nmax connection TTL by default. Keep in mind that the\nheartBeatToConnectionTtlModifier is relevant here. For example, if a client\nsends a heart-beat header of 20000,0 and the acceptor is using a\nconnectionTtlMax of 30000 and a default heartBeatToConnectionTtlModifier of\n2.0 then the connection TTL would be 40000 (i.e. 20000 * 2.0) which\nwould exceed the connectionTtlMax. In this case the server would respond to\nthe client with a heart-beat header of 0,15000 (i.e. 30000 / 2.0). As\ndescribed previously, this is to make sure there is a sufficient cushion for\nthe client heart-beats in accordance with the STOMP 1.1 and 1.2 specifications.\nThe same kind of calculation is done for connectionTtlMin.\nThe minimum server-to-client heart-beat value is 500ms.\n\nNote:\nPlease note that the STOMP protocol version 1.0 does not contain any\nheart-beat frame. It is therefore the user's responsibility to make sure data\nis sent within connection-ttl or the server will assume the client is dead\nand clean up server side resources. With STOMP 1.1 users can use heart-beats\nto maintain the life cycle of stomp connections.\n\nSelector/Filter expressions\nSTOMP subscribers can specify an expression used to select or filter what the\nsubscriber receives using the selector header. The filter expression syntax\nfollows the core filter syntax described in the Filter\nExpressions documentation.\nSTOMP and JMS interoperability\nSending and consuming STOMP message from JMS or Core API\nSTOMP is mainly a text-orientated protocol. To make it simpler to interoperate\nwith JMS and Core API, our STOMP implementation checks for presence of the\ncontent-length header to decide how to map a STOMP 1.0 message to a JMS\nMessage or a Core message.\nIf the STOMP 1.0 message does not have a content-length header, it will be\nmapped to a JMS TextMessage or a Core message with a single nullable\nSimpleString in the body buffer.\nAlternatively, if the STOMP 1.0 message has a content-length header, it\nwill be mapped to a JMS BytesMessage or a Core message with a byte[] in the\nbody buffer.\nThe same logic applies when mapping a JMS message or a Core message to STOMP. A\nSTOMP 1.0 client can check the presence of the content-length header to\ndetermine the type of the message body (String or bytes).\nMessage IDs for STOMP messages\nWhen receiving STOMP messages via a JMS consumer or a QueueBrowser, the\nmessages have no properties like JMSMessageID by default. However this may\nbring some inconvenience to clients who wants an ID for their purpose. The\nbroker STOMP provides a parameter to enable message ID on each incoming STOMP\nmessage. If you want each STOMP message to have a unique ID, just set the\nstompEnableMessageId to true. For example:\ntcp://localhost:61613?protocols=STOMP;stompEnableMessageId=true\n\nWhen the server starts with the above setting, each stomp message sent through\nthis acceptor will have an extra property added. The property key is\namqMessageId and the value is a String representation of a long type\ninternal message id prefixed with STOMP, like:\namqMessageId : STOMP12345\nThe default stompEnableMessageId value is false.\nDurable Subscriptions\nThe SUBSCRIBE and UNSUBSCRIBE frames can be augmented with special headers\nto create and destroy durable subscriptions respectively.\nTo create a durable subscription the client-id header must be set on the\nCONNECT frame and the durable-subscription-name must be set on the\nSUBSCRIBE frame. The combination of these two headers will form the identity\nof the durable subscription.\nTo delete a durable subscription the client-id header must be set on the\nCONNECT frame and the durable-subscription-name must be set on the\nUNSUBSCRIBE frame. The values for these headers should match what was set on\nthe SUBSCRIBE frame to delete the corresponding durable subscription.\nAside from durable-subscription-name, the broker also supports\ndurable-subscriber-name (a deprecated property used before\ndurable-subscription-name) as well as activemq.subscriptionName from ActiveMQ\n5.x. This is the order of precedence if the frame contains more than one of these:\n1) durable-subscriber-name\n2) durable-subscription-name\n3) activemq.subscriptionName\nIt is possible to pre-configure durable subscriptions since the STOMP\nimplementation creates the queue used for the durable subscription in a\ndeterministic way (i.e. using the format of client-id.subscription-name).\nFor example, if you wanted to configure a durable subscription on the address\nmyAddress with a client-id of myclientid and a subscription name of\nmysubscription then configure the durable subscription:\n\n   \n      \n         \n      \n   \n\n\nHandling of Large Messages with STOMP\nSTOMP clients may send very large frame bodies which can exceed the size of the\nbroker's internal buffer, causing unexpected errors. To prevent this situation\nfrom happening, the broker provides a STOMP configuration attribute\nstompMinLargeMessageSize. This attribute can be configured inside a stomp\nacceptor, as a parameter. For example:\ntcp://localhost:61613?protocols=STOMP;stompMinLargeMessageSize=10240\n\nThe type of this attribute is integer. When this attributed is configured, the\nbroker will check the size of the body of each STOMP frame arrived from\nconnections established with this acceptor. If the size of the body is equal or\ngreater than the value of stompMinLargeMessageSize, the message will be\npersisted as a large message. When a large message is delievered to a STOMP\nconsumer, the broker will automatically handle the conversion from a large\nmessage to a normal message, before sending it to the client.\nIf a large message is compressed, the server will uncompressed it before\nsending it to stomp clients. The default value of stompMinLargeMessageSize is\nthe same as the default value of\nminLargeMessageSize.\nWeb Sockets\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis also supports STOMP over Web\nSockets.  Modern web\nbrowsers which support Web Sockets can send and receive STOMP messages.\nSTOMP over Web Sockets is supported via the normal STOMP acceptor:\ntcp://localhost:61614?protocols=STOMP\n\nWith this configuration, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis will accept STOMP connections\nover Web Sockets on the port 61614. Web browsers can then connect to\nws://:61614 using a Web Socket to send and receive STOMP messages.\nA companion JavaScript library to ease client-side development is available\nfrom GitHub (please see its\ndocumentation for a complete\ndescription).\nThe payload length of Web Socket frames can vary between client\nimplementations. By default the broker will accept frames with a payload length\nof 65,536. If the client needs to send payloads longer than this in a single\nframe this length can be adjusted by using the stompMaxFramePayloadLength URL\nparameter on the acceptor.\nThe stomp-websockets example shows how to configure an Apache ActiveMQ\nArtemis broker to have web browsers and Java applications exchanges messages.\nFlow Control\nSTOMP clients can use the consumer-window-size header on the SUBSCRIBE\nframe to control the flow of messages to clients. This is broadly discussed in\nthe Flow Control chapter.\nThis ability is similiar to the activemq.prefetchSize header supported by\nActiveMQ 5.x. However, that header specifies the size in terms of messages\nwhereas consumer-window-size specifies the size in terms of bytes. ActiveMQ\nArtemis supports the activemq.prefetchSize header for backwards compatibility\nbut the value will be interpreted as bytes just like consumer-window-size\nwould be. If both activemq.prefetchSize and consumer-window-size are set\nthen the value for consumer-window-size will be used.\nSetting consumer-window-size to 0 will ensure that once a STOMP client\nreceives a message that it will not receive another one until it sends the\nappropriate ACK or NACK frame for the message it already has.\nSetting consumer-window-size to a value greater than 0 will allow it to\nreceive messages until the cumulative bytes of those messages reaches the\nconfigured size. Once that happens the client will not receive any more\nmessages until it sends the appropriate ACK or NACK frame for the messages\nit already has.\nSetting consumer-window-size to -1 means there is no flow control and the\nbroker will dispatch messages to clients as fast as it can.\nFlow control can be configured at the acceptor as well using the\nstompConsumerWindowSize URL parameter. This value is 10240 (i.e. 10K) by\ndefault for clients using client and client-individual acknowledgement\nmodes. It is -1 for clients using the auto acknowledgement mode. Even\nif stompConsumerWindowSize is set on the STOMP acceptor it will be\noverriden by the value provided by individual clients using the\nconsumer-window-size header on their SUBSCRIBE frame.\n\nNote:\nThe stompConsumerWindowSize URL parameter used to be called\nstompConsumerCredits but was changed to be more consistent with the new\nheader name (i.e. consumer-window-size). The stompConsumerCredits\nparameter is deprecated but it will still work for the time being.\n\nUsing the DEBUG logging mentioned earlier it is possible to see the\nsize of the MESSAGE frames dispatched to clients. This can help when trying\nto determine the best consumer-window-size setting.\n"},"openwire.html":{"url":"openwire.html","title":"OpenWire","keywords":"","body":"OpenWire\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis supports the\nOpenWire protocol so that an Apache\nActiveMQ 5.x JMS client can talk directly to an Apache ActiveMQ Artemis server.\nBy default there is an acceptor configured to accept OpenWire connections on\nport 61616.\nSee the general Protocols and Interoperability\nchapter for details on configuring an acceptor for OpenWire.\nRefer to the OpenWire examples for a look at this functionality in action.\nConnection Monitoring\nOpenWire has a few parameters to control how each connection is monitored, they\nare:\n\nmaxInactivityDuration\nIt specifies the time (milliseconds) after which the connection is closed by\nthe broker if no data was received.  Default value is 30000.\n\nmaxInactivityDurationInitalDelay\nIt specifies the maximum delay (milliseconds) before inactivity monitoring is\nstarted on the connection. It can be useful if a broker is under load with many\nconnections being created concurrently. Default value is 10000.\n\nuseInactivityMonitor\nA value of false disables the InactivityMonitor completely and connections\nwill never time out. By default it is enabled. On broker side you don't neet\nset this. Instead you can set the connection-ttl to -1.\n\nuseKeepAlive\nWhether or not to send a KeepAliveInfo on an idle connection to prevent it\nfrom timing out. Enabled by default.  Disabling the keep alive will still make\nconnections time out if no data was received on the connection for the\nspecified amount of time.\n\n\nNote at the beginning the InactivityMonitor negotiates the appropriate\nmaxInactivityDuration and maxInactivityDurationInitalDelay. The shortest\nduration is taken for the connection.\nFore more details please see ActiveMQ\nInactivityMonitor.\nDisable/Enable Advisories\nBy default, advisory topics (ActiveMQ\nAdvisory) are created in\norder to send certain type of advisory messages to listening clients. As a\nresult, advisory addresses and queues will be displayed on the management\nconsole, along with user deployed addresses and queues. This sometimes cause\nconfusion because the advisory objects are internally managed without user\nbeing aware of them. In addition, users may not want the advisory topics at all\n(they cause extra resources and performance penalty) and it is convenient to\ndisable them at all from the broker side.\nThe protocol provides two parameters to control advisory behaviors on the\nbroker side.\n\nsupportAdvisory\nWhether or not the broker supports advisory messages. If the value is true,\nadvisory addresses/queues will be created.  If the value is false, no advisory\naddresses/queues are created. Default value is true. \n\nsuppressInternalManagementObjects\nWhether or not the advisory addresses/queues, if any, will be registered to\nmanagement service (e.g. JMX registry). If set to true, no advisory\naddresses/queues will be registered. If set to false, those are registered and\nwill be displayed on the management console. Default value is true.\n\n\nThe two parameters are configured on an OpenWire acceptor, e.g.:\ntcp://localhost:61616?protocols=OPENWIRE;supportAdvisory=true;suppressInternalManagementObjects=false\n\nVirtual Topic Consumer Destination Translation\nFor existing OpenWire consumers of virtual topic destinations it is possible to\nconfigure a mapping function that will translate the virtual topic consumer\ndestination into a FQQN address. This address will then represents the consumer as a\nmulticast binding to an address representing the virtual topic. \nThe configuration string property virtualTopicConsumerWildcards has two parts\nseparated by a ;. The first is the 5.x style destination filter that\nidentifies the destination as belonging to a virtual topic. The second\nidentifies the number of paths that identify the consumer queue such that it\ncan be parsed from the destination. For example, the default 5.x virtual topic\nwith consumer prefix of Consumer.*., would require a\nvirtualTopicConsumerWildcards filter of Consumer.*.>;2. As a url parameter\nthis transforms to Consumer.*.%3E%3B2 when the url significant characters\n>; are escaped with their hex code points. In an acceptor url it would be:\ntcp://localhost:61616?protocols=OPENWIRE;virtualTopicConsumerWildcards=Consumer.*.%3E%3B2\n\nThis will translate Consumer.A.VirtualTopic.Orders into a FQQN of\nVirtualTopic.Orders::Consumer.A.VirtualTopic.Orders using the int component 2 of the\nconfiguration to identify the consumer queue as the first two paths of the\ndestination.  virtualTopicConsumerWildcards is multi valued using a ,\nseparator.\nPlease see Virtual Topic Mapping example contained in the OpenWire\nexamples.\n"},"core.html":{"url":"core.html","title":"Core","keywords":"","body":"Using Core\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis core is a messaging system with its own API. We call\nthis the core API.\nIf you don't want to use the JMS API or any of the other supported protocols\nyou can use the core API directly. The core API provides all the functionality\nof JMS but without much of the complexity. It also provides features that are\nnot available using JMS.\nCore Messaging Concepts\nSome of the core messaging concepts are similar to JMS concepts, but core\nmessaging concepts are also different in some ways as well. In general the core\nAPI is simpler than the JMS API, since we remove distinctions between queues,\ntopics and subscriptions. We'll discuss each of the major core messaging\nconcepts in turn, but to see the API in detail please consult the Javadoc.\nAlso refer to the addressing model chapter for a high-level\noverview of these concepts as well as configuration details.\nMessage\n\nA message is the unit of data which is sent between clients and servers.\n\nA message has a body which is a buffer containing convenient methods for\nreading and writing data into it.\n\nA message has a set of properties which are key-value pairs. Each property\nkey is a string and property values can be of type integer, long, short,\nbyte, byte[], String, double, float or boolean.\n\nA message has an address it is being sent to. When the message arrives on\nthe server it is routed to any queues that are bound to the address. The\nrouting semantics (i.e. anycast or multicast) are determined by the \"routing\ntype\" of the address and queue. If the queues are bound with any filter, the\nmessage will only be routed to that queue if the filter matches. An address may\nhave many queues bound to it or even none. There may also be entities other\nthan queues (e.g. diverts) bound to addresses.\n\nMessages can be either durable or non durable. Durable messages in a durable\nqueue will survive a server crash or restart. Non durable messages will never\nsurvive a server crash or restart.\n\nMessages can be specified with a priority value between 0 and 9. 0 represents\nthe lowest priority and 9 represents the highest. The broker will attempt to\ndeliver higher priority messages before lower priority ones.\n\nMessages can be specified with an optional expiry time. The broker will not\ndeliver messages after its expiry time has been exceeded.\n\nMessages also have an optional timestamp which represents the time the\nmessage was sent.\n\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis also supports the sending/consuming of very large\nmessages much larger than can fit in available RAM at any one time.\n\n\nAddress\nA server maintains a mapping between an address and a set of queues. Zero or\nmore queues can be bound to a single address. Each queue can be bound with an\noptional message filter. When a message is routed, it is routed to the set of\nqueues bound to the message's address. If any of the queues are bound with a\nfilter expression, then the message will only be routed to the subset of bound\nqueues which match that filter expression.\nOther entities, such as diverts can also be bound to an address and messages\nwill also be routed there.\n\nNote:\nAlthough core supports publish-subscribe semantics there is no such thing as\na \"topic\" per se. \"Topic\" is mainly a JMS term. In core we just deal with\naddresses, queues, and routing types.\nFor example, a JMS topic would be implemented by a single address to which\nmany queues are bound using multicast routing. Each queue represents a\n\"subscription\" in normal \"topic\" terms. A JMS queue would be implemented as a\nsingle address to which one queue is bound using anycast routing - that queue\nrepresents the JMS queue.\n\nQueue\nQueues can be durable, meaning the messages they contain survive a server crash\nor restart, as long as the messages in them are durable. Non durable queues do\nnot survive a server restart or crash even if the messages they contain are\ndurable.\nQueues can also be temporary, meaning they are automatically deleted when the\nclient connection is closed, if they are not explicitly deleted before that.\nQueues can be bound with an optional filter expression. If a filter expression\nis supplied then the server will only route messages that match that filter\nexpression to any queues bound to the address.\nMany queues can be bound to a single address. A particular queue is only bound\nto a maximum of one address.\nRouting Type\nThe routing type determines the semantics used when routing messages to the\nqueues bound to the address where the message was sent. Two types are\nsupported:\n\nANYCAST\nThe message is routed to only one of the queues bound to the address. If\nmultiple queues are bound to the address then messages are routed to them in a\nround-robin fashion.\n\nMULTICAST\nThe message is route to all of the queues bound to the address.\n\n\nCore API\nServerLocator\nClients use ServerLocator instances to create ClientSessionFactory\ninstances. ServerLocator instances are used to locate servers and create\nconnections to them.\nIn JMS terms think of a ServerLocator in the same way you would a JMS\nConnection Factory.\nServerLocator instances are created using the ActiveMQClient factory class.\nClientSessionFactory\nClients use ClientSessionFactory instances to create ClientSession\ninstances. ClientSessionFactory instances are basically the connection to a\nserver\nIn JMS terms think of them as JMS Connections.\nClientSessionFactory instances are created using the ServerLocator class.\nClientSession\nA client uses a ClientSessionfor consuming and producing messages and for\ngrouping them in transactions. ClientSession instances can support both\ntransactional and non transactional semantics and also provide an XAResource\ninterface so messaging operations can be performed as part of a\nJTA\ntransaction.\nClientSession instances group ClientConsumer instances and ClientProducer\ninstances.\nClientSession instances can be registered with an optional\nSendAcknowledgementHandler. This allows your client code to be notified\nasynchronously when sent messages have successfully reached the server. This\nunique Apache ActiveMQ Artemis feature, allows you to have full guarantees that\nsent messages have reached the server without having to block on each message\nsent until a response is received. Blocking on each messages sent is costly\nsince it requires a network round trip for each message sent. By not blocking\nand receiving send acknowledgements asynchronously you can create true end to\nend asynchronous systems which is not possible using the standard JMS API. For\nmore information on this advanced feature please see the section Guarantees of\nsends and commits.\nClientConsumer\nClients use ClientConsumer instances to consume messages from a queue. Core\nmessaging supports both synchronous and asynchronous message consumption\nsemantics. ClientConsumer instances can be configured with an optional filter\nexpression and will only consume messages which match that expression.\nClientProducer\nClients create ClientProducer instances on ClientSession instances so they\ncan send messages. ClientProducer instances can specify an address to which\nall sent messages are routed, or they can have no specified address, and the\naddress is specified at send time for the message.\n\nWarning\nPlease note that ClientSession, ClientProducer and ClientConsumer\ninstances are designed to be re-used.\nIt's an anti-pattern to create new ClientSession, ClientProducer and\nClientConsumer instances for each message you produce or consume. If you do\nthis, your application will perform very poorly. This is  discussed further\nin the section on performance tuning Performance Tuning.\n\nA simple example of using Core\nHere's a very simple program using the core messaging API to send and receive a\nmessage. Logically it's comprised of two sections: firstly setting up the\nproducer to write a message to an addresss, and secondly, creating a queue\nfor the consumer using anycast routing, creating the consumer, and starting\nit.\nServerLocator locator = ActiveMQClient.createServerLocator(\"vm://0\");\n\n// In this simple example, we just use one session for both producing and receiving\n\nClientSessionFactory factory =  locator.createClientSessionFactory();\nClientSession session = factory.createSession();\n\n// A producer is associated with an address ...\n\nClientProducer producer = session.createProducer(\"example\");\nClientMessage message = session.createMessage(true);\nmessage.getBodyBuffer().writeString(\"Hello\");\n\n// We need a queue attached to the address ...\n\nsession.createQueue(\"example\", RoutingType.ANYCAST, \"example\", true);\n\n// And a consumer attached to the queue ...\n\nClientConsumer consumer = session.createConsumer(\"example\");\n\n// Once we have a queue, we can send the message ...\n\nproducer.send(message);\n\n// We need to start the session before we can -receive- messages ...\n\nsession.start();\nClientMessage msgReceived = consumer.receive();\n\nSystem.out.println(\"message = \" + msgReceived.getBodyBuffer().readString());\n\nsession.close();\n\n"},"jms-core-mapping.html":{"url":"jms-core-mapping.html","title":"Mapping JMS Concepts to the Core API","keywords":"","body":"Mapping JMS Concepts to the Core API\nThis chapter describes how JMS destinations are mapped to Apache ActiveMQ\nArtemis addresses.\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis core is JMS-agnostic.

If you are completely new to JMS we suggest you follow the\nOracle JMS\ntutorial - a full\nJMS tutorial is out of scope for this guide.\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis also ships with a wide range of examples, many of which\ndemonstrate JMS API usage. A good place to start would be to play around with\nthe simple JMS Queue and Topic example, but we also provide examples for many\nother parts of the JMS API. A full description of the examples is available in\nExamples.\nIn this section we'll go through the main steps in configuring the server for\nJMS and creating a simple JMS program. We'll also show how to configure and use\nJNDI, and also how to use JMS with Apache ActiveMQ Artemis without using any\nJNDI.\nA simple ordering system\nFor this chapter we're going to use a very simple ordering system as our\nexample. It is a somewhat contrived example because of its extreme simplicity,\nbut it serves to demonstrate the very basics of setting up and using JMS.\nWe will have a single JMS Queue called OrderQueue, and we will have a single\nMessageProducer sending an order message to the queue and a single\nMessageConsumer consuming the order message from the queue.\nThe queue will be a durable queue, i.e. it will survive a server restart or\ncrash. We also want to pre-deploy the queue, i.e. specify the queue in the\nserver configuration so it is created automatically without us having to\nexplicitly create it from the client.\nJNDI\nThe JMS specification establishes the convention that administered objects\n(i.e. JMS queue, topic and connection factory instances) are made available via\nthe JNDI API. Brokers are free to implement JNDI as they see fit assuming the\nimplementation fits the API. Apache ActiveMQ Artemis does not have a JNDI\nserver. Rather, it uses a client-side JNDI implementation that relies on\nspecial properties set in the environment to construct the appropriate JMS\nobjects. In other words, no objects are stored in JNDI on the Apache ActiveMQ\nArtemis server, instead they are simply instantiated on the client based on the\nprovided configuration. Let's look at the different kinds of administered\nobjects and how to configure them.\n\nNote:\nThe following configuration properties are strictly required when Apache\nActiveMQ Artemis is running in stand-alone mode. When Apache ActiveMQ\nArtemis is integrated to an application server (e.g. Wildfly) the application\nserver itself will almost certainly provide a JNDI client with its own\nproperties.\n\nConnectionFactory JNDI\nA JMS connection factory is used by the client to make connections to the\nserver. It knows the location of the server it is connecting to, as well as\nmany other configuration parameters.\nHere's a simple example of the JNDI context environment for a client looking up\na connection factory to access an embedded instance of Apache ActiveMQ\nArtemis:\njava.naming.factory.initial=org.apache.activemq.artemis.jndi.ActiveMQInitialContextFactory\nconnectionFactory.invmConnectionFactory=vm://0\n\nIn this instance we have created a connection factory that is bound to\ninvmConnectionFactory, any entry with prefix connectionFactory. will create\na connection factory.\nIn certain situations there could be multiple server instances running within a\nparticular JVM. In that situation each server would typically have an InVM\nacceptor with a unique server-ID. A client using JMS and JNDI can account for\nthis by specifying a connction factory for each server, like so:\njava.naming.factory.initial=org.apache.activemq.artemis.jndi.ActiveMQInitialContextFactory\nconnectionFactory.invmConnectionFactory0=vm://0\nconnectionFactory.invmConnectionFactory1=vm://1\nconnectionFactory.invmConnectionFactory2=vm://2\n\nHere is a list of all the supported URL schemes:\n\nvm\ntcp\nudp\njgroups\n\nMost clients won't be connecting to an embedded broker. Clients will most\ncommonly connect across a network a remote broker. Here's a simple example of a\nclient configuring a connection factory to connect to a remote broker running\non myhost:5445:\njava.naming.factory.initial=org.apache.activemq.artemis.jndi.ActiveMQInitialContextFactory\nconnectionFactory.ConnectionFactory=tcp://myhost:5445\n\nIn the example above the client is using the tcp scheme for the provider URL.\nA client may also specify multiple comma-delimited host:port combinations in\nthe URL (e.g.  (tcp://remote-host1:5445,remote-host2:5445)). Whether there is\none or many host:port combinations in the URL they are treated as the initial\nconnector(s) for the underlying connection.\nThe udp scheme is also supported which should use a host:port combination\nthat matches the group-address and group-port from the corresponding\nbroadcast-group configured on the ActiveMQ Artemis server(s).\nEach scheme has a specific set of properties which can be set using the\ntraditional URL query string format (e.g.\nscheme://host:port?key1=value1&key2=value2) to customize the underlying\ntransport mechanism. For example, if a client wanted to connect to a remote\nserver using TCP and SSL it would create a connection factory like so,\ntcp://remote-host:5445?ssl-enabled=true.\nAll the properties available for the tcp scheme are described in the\ndocumentation regarding the Netty\ntransport.\nNote if you are using the tcp scheme and multiple addresses then a query can\nbe applied to all the url's or just to an individual connector, so where you\nhave\n\n(tcp://remote-host1:5445?httpEnabled=true,remote-host2:5445?httpEnabled=true)?clientID=1234\n\nthen the httpEnabled property is only set on the individual connectors where\nas the clientId is set on the actual connection factory. Any connector\nspecific properties set on the whole URI will be applied to all the connectors.\nThe udp scheme supports 4 properties:\n\nlocalAddress - If you are running with multiple network\ninterfaces on the same machine, you may want to specify that the\ndiscovery group listens only only a specific interface. To do this\nyou can specify the interface address with this parameter.\n\nlocalPort - If you want to specify a local port to which the\ndatagram socket is bound you can specify it here. Normally you would\njust use the default value of -1 which signifies that an anonymous\nport should be used. This parameter is always specified in\nconjunction with localAddress.\n\nrefreshTimeout - This is the period the discovery group waits after\nreceiving the last broadcast from a particular server before removing that\nservers connector pair entry from its list. You would normally set this to a\nvalue significantly higher than the broadcast-period on the broadcast group\notherwise servers might intermittently disappear from the list even though they\nare still broadcasting due to slight differences in timing. This parameter is\noptional, the default value is 10000 milliseconds (10 seconds).\n\ndiscoveryInitialWaitTimeout - If the connection factory is used immediately\nafter creation then it may not have had enough time to received broadcasts\nfrom all the nodes in the cluster. On first usage, the connection factory will\nmake sure it waits this long since creation before creating the first\nconnection. The default value for this parameter is 10000 milliseconds.\n\n\nLastly, the jgroups scheme is supported which provides an alternative to the\nudp scheme for server discovery. The URL pattern is either\njgroups://channelName?file=jgroups-xml-conf-filename\nwherejgroups-xml-conf-filename refers to an XML file on the classpath that\ncontains the JGroups configuration or it can be\njgroups://channelName?properties=some-jgroups-properties. In both instance\nthe channelName is the name given to the jgroups channel created.\nThe refreshTimeout and discoveryInitialWaitTimeout properties are supported\njust like with udp.\nThe default type for the default connection factory is of type\njavax.jms.ConnectionFactory.  This can be changed by setting the type like so\njava.naming.factory.initial=org.apache.activemq.artemis.jndi.ActiveMQInitialContextFactory\njava.naming.provider.url=tcp://localhost:5445?type=CF\n\nIn this example it is still set to the default, below shows a list of types\nthat can be set.\nConfiguration for Connection Factory Types\n\n\n\ntype\ninterface\n\n\n\n\nCF (default)\njavax.jms.ConnectionFactory\n\n\nXA_CF\njavax.jms.XAConnectionFactory\n\n\nQUEUE_CF\njavax.jms.QueueConnectionFactory\n\n\nQUEUE_XA_CF\njavax.jms.XAQueueConnectionFactory\n\n\nTOPIC_CF\njavax.jms.TopicConnectionFactory\n\n\nTOPIC_XA_CF\njavax.jms.XATopicConnectionFactory\n\n\n\nDestination JNDI\nJMS destinations are also typically looked up via JNDI. As with connection\nfactories, destinations can be configured using special properties in the JNDI\ncontext environment. The property name should follow the pattern:\nqueue. or topic..  The property value should\nbe the name of the queue hosted by the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis server. For\nexample, if the server had a JMS queue configured like so:\n\n   \n\n\nAnd if the client wanted to bind this queue to \"queues/OrderQueue\" then the\nJNDI properties would be configured like so:\njava.naming.factory.initial=org.apache.activemq.artemis.jndi.ActiveMQInitialContextFactory\njava.naming.provider.url=tcp://myhost:5445\nqueue.queues/OrderQueue=OrderQueue\n\nIt is also possible to look-up JMS destinations which haven't been configured\nexplicitly in the JNDI context environment. This is possible using\ndynamicQueues/ or dynamicTopics/ in the look-up string. For example, if the\nclient wanted to look-up the aforementioned \"OrderQueue\" it could do so simply\nby using the string \"dynamicQueues/OrderQueue\".  Note, the text that follows\ndynamicQueues/ or dynamicTopics/ must correspond exactly to the name of\nthe destination on the server.\nThe code\nHere's the code for the example:\nFirst we'll create a JNDI initial context from which to lookup our JMS objects.\nIf the above properties are set in jndi.properties and it is on the classpath\nthen any new, empty InitialContext will be initialized using those\nproperties: \nInitialContext ic = new InitialContext();\n\n//Now we'll look up the connection factory from which we can create\n//connections to myhost:5445:\n\nConnectionFactory cf = (ConnectionFactory)ic.lookup(\"ConnectionFactory\");\n\n//And look up the Queue:\n\nQueue orderQueue = (Queue)ic.lookup(\"queues/OrderQueue\");\n\n//Next we create a JMS connection using the connection factory:\n\nConnection connection = cf.createConnection();\n\n//And we create a non transacted JMS Session, with AUTO\\_ACKNOWLEDGE\n//acknowledge mode:\n\nSession session = connection.createSession(false, Session.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE);\n\n//We create a MessageProducer that will send orders to the queue:\n\nMessageProducer producer = session.createProducer(orderQueue);\n\n//And we create a MessageConsumer which will consume orders from the\n//queue:\n\nMessageConsumer consumer = session.createConsumer(orderQueue);\n\n//We make sure we start the connection, or delivery won't occur on it:\n\nconnection.start();\n\n//We create a simple TextMessage and send it:\n\nTextMessage message = session.createTextMessage(\"This is an order\");\nproducer.send(message);\n\n//And we consume the message:\n\nTextMessage receivedMessage = (TextMessage)consumer.receive();\nSystem.out.println(\"Got order: \" + receivedMessage.getText());\n\nIt is as simple as that. For a wide range of working JMS examples please\nsee the examples directory in the distribution.\n\nWarning\nPlease note that JMS connections, sessions, producers and consumers are\ndesigned to be re-used.\nIt is an anti-pattern to create new connections, sessions, producers and\nconsumers for each message you produce or consume. If you do this, your\napplication will perform very poorly. This is discussed further in the\nsection on performance tuning Performance Tuning.\n\nDirectly instantiating JMS Resources without using JNDI\nAlthough it is a very common JMS usage pattern to lookup JMS Administered\nObjects (that's JMS Queue, Topic and ConnectionFactory instances) from JNDI,\nin some cases you just think \"Why do I need JNDI?  Why can't I just instantiate\nthese objects directly?\"\nWith Apache ActiveMQ Artemis you can do exactly that. Apache ActiveMQ Artemis\nsupports the direct instantiation of JMS Queue, Topic and ConnectionFactory\ninstances, so you don't have to use JNDI at all.\n\nFor a full working example of direct instantiation please look at the\nInstantiate JMS Objects \nDirectly example under the JMS \nsection of the examples.\n\nHere's our simple example, rewritten to not use JNDI at all:\nWe create the JMS ConnectionFactory object via the ActiveMQJMSClient Utility\nclass, note we need to provide connection parameters and specify which\ntransport we are using, for more information on connectors please see\nConfiguring the Transport.\nTransportConfiguration transportConfiguration = new TransportConfiguration(NettyConnectorFactory.class.getName());\n\nConnectionFactory cf = ActiveMQJMSClient.createConnectionFactoryWithoutHA(JMSFactoryType.CF,transportConfiguration);\n\n//We also create the JMS Queue object via the ActiveMQJMSClient Utility\n//class:\n\nQueue orderQueue = ActiveMQJMSClient.createQueue(\"OrderQueue\");\n\n//Next we create a JMS connection using the connection factory:\n\nConnection connection = cf.createConnection();\n\n//And we create a non transacted JMS Session, with AUTO\\_ACKNOWLEDGE\n//acknowledge mode:\n\nSession session = connection.createSession(false, Session.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE);\n\n//We create a MessageProducer that will send orders to the queue:\n\nMessageProducer producer = session.createProducer(orderQueue);\n\n//And we create a MessageConsumer which will consume orders from the\n//queue:\n\nMessageConsumer consumer = session.createConsumer(orderQueue);\n\n//We make sure we start the connection, or delivery won't occur on it:\n\nconnection.start();\n\n//We create a simple TextMessage and send it:\n\nTextMessage message = session.createTextMessage(\"This is an order\");\nproducer.send(message);\n\n//And we consume the message:\n\nTextMessage receivedMessage = (TextMessage)consumer.receive();\nSystem.out.println(\"Got order: \" + receivedMessage.getText());\n\nSetting The Client ID\nThis represents the client id for a JMS client and is needed for creating\ndurable subscriptions. It is possible to configure this on the connection\nfactory and can be set via the clientId element. Any connection created by\nthis connection factory will have this set as its client id.\nSetting The Batch Size for DUPS_OK\nWhen the JMS acknowledge mode is set to DUPS_OK it is possible to configure\nthe consumer so that it sends acknowledgements in batches rather that one at a\ntime, saving valuable bandwidth. This can be configured via the connection\nfactory via the dupsOkBatchSize element and is set in bytes. The default is\n1024 * 1024 bytes = 1 MiB.\nSetting The Transaction Batch Size\nWhen receiving messages in a transaction it is possible to configure the\nconsumer to send acknowledgements in batches rather than individually saving\nvaluable bandwidth. This can be configured on the connection factory via the\ntransactionBatchSize element and is set in bytes.  The default is 1024 *\n1024.\nSetting The Destination Cache\nMany frameworks such as Spring resolve the destination by name on every\noperation, this can cause a performance issue and extra calls to the broker, in\na scenario where destinations (addresses) are permanent broker side, such as\nthey are managed by a platform or operations team.  using cacheDestinations\nelement, you can toggle on the destination cache to improve the performance and\nreduce the calls to the broker.  This should not be used if destinations\n(addresses) are not permanent broker side, as in dynamic creation/deletion.\n"},"client-classpath.html":{"url":"client-classpath.html","title":"The Client Classpath","keywords":"","body":"The Client Classpath\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis requires just a single jar on the client classpath.\n\nWarning\nThe client jar mentioned here can be found in the lib/client directory of\nthe Apache ActiveMQ Artemis distribution.

Application-layer failover differs from automatic failover in that some\nclient side coding is required in order to implement this. Also, with\nApplication-layer failover, since the old session object dies and a new one is\ncreated, any uncommitted work in the old session will be lost, and any\nunacknowledged messages might be redelivered.\nCore Bridge Example\nThe bridge example demonstrates a core bridge deployed on one server, which\nconsumes messages from a local queue and forwards them to an address on a\nsecond server.\nCore bridges are used to create message flows between any two Apache ActiveMQ\nArtemis servers which are remotely separated. Core bridges are resilient and\nwill cope with temporary connection failure allowing them to be an ideal choice\nfor forwarding over unreliable connections, e.g. a WAN.\nBrowser\nThe browser example shows you how to use a JMS QueueBrowser with Apache\nActiveMQ Artemis.\nQueues are a standard part of JMS, please consult the JMS 2.0 specification for\nfull details.\nA QueueBrowser is used to look at messages on the queue without removing\nthem. It can scan the entire content of a queue or only messages matching a\nmessage selector.\nCamel\nThe camel example demonstrates how to build and deploy a Camel route to the\nbroker using a web application archive (i.e. war file).\nClient Kickoff\nThe client-kickoff example shows how to terminate client connections given an\nIP address using the JMX management API.\nClient side failover listener\nThe client-side-failoverlistener example shows how to register a listener to\nmonitor failover events\nClient-Side Load-Balancing\nThe client-side-load-balancing example demonstrates how sessions created from\na single JMS Connection can be created to different nodes of the cluster. In\nother words it demonstrates how Apache ActiveMQ Artemis does client-side\nload-balancing of sessions across the cluster.\nClustered Durable Subscription\nThis example demonstrates a clustered JMS durable subscription\nClustered Grouping\nThis is similar to the message grouping example except that it demonstrates it\nworking over a cluster. Messages sent to different nodes with the same group id\nwill be sent to the same node and the same consumer.\nClustered Queue\nThe clustered-queue example demonstrates a queue deployed on two different\nnodes. The two nodes are configured to form a cluster. We then create a\nconsumer for the queue on each node, and we create a producer on only one of\nthe nodes. We then send some messages via the producer, and we verify that both\nconsumers receive the sent messages in a round-robin fashion.\nClustering with JGroups\nThe clustered-jgroups example demonstrates how to form a two node cluster\nusing JGroups as its underlying topology discovery technique, rather than the\ndefault UDP broadcasting. We then create a consumer for the queue on each node,\nand we create a producer on only one of the nodes. We then send some messages\nvia the producer, and we verify that both consumers receive the sent messages\nin a round-robin fashion.\nClustered Standalone\nThe clustered-standalone example demonstrates how to configure and starts 3\ncluster nodes on the same machine to form a cluster. A subscriber for a JMS\ntopic is created on each node, and we create a producer on only one of the\nnodes. We then send some messages via the producer, and we verify that the 3\nsubscribers receive all the sent messages.\nClustered Static Discovery\nThis example demonstrates how to configure a cluster using a list of connectors\nrather than UDP for discovery\nClustered Static Cluster One Way\nThis example demonstrates how to set up a cluster where cluster connections are\none way, i.e. server A -> Server B -> Server C\nClustered Topic\nThe clustered-topic example demonstrates a JMS topic deployed on two\ndifferent nodes. The two nodes are configured to form a cluster. We then create\na subscriber on the topic on each node, and we create a producer on only one of\nthe nodes. We then send some messages via the producer, and we verify that both\nsubscribers receive all the sent messages.\nMessage Consumer Rate Limiting\nWith Apache ActiveMQ Artemis you can specify a maximum consume rate at which a\nJMS MessageConsumer will consume messages. This can be specified when creating\nor deploying the connection factory.\nIf this value is specified then Apache ActiveMQ Artemis will ensure that\nmessages are never consumed at a rate higher than the specified rate. This is a\nform of consumer throttling.\nDead Letter\nThe dead-letter example shows you how to define and deal with dead letter\nmessages. Messages can be delivered unsuccessfully (e.g. if the transacted\nsession used to consume them is rolled back).\nSuch a message goes back to the JMS destination ready to be redelivered.\nHowever, this means it is possible for a message to be delivered again and\nagain without any success and remain in the destination, clogging the system.\nTo prevent this, messaging systems define dead letter messages: after a\nspecified unsuccessful delivery attempts, the message is removed from the\ndestination and put instead in a dead letter destination where they can be\nconsumed for further investigation.\nDelayed Redelivery\nThe delayed-redelivery example demonstrates how Apache ActiveMQ Artemis can\nbe configured to provide a delayed redelivery in the case a message needs to be\nredelivered.\nDelaying redelivery can often be useful in the case that clients regularly fail\nor roll-back. Without a delayed redelivery, the system can get into a\n\"thrashing\" state, with delivery being attempted, the client rolling back, and\ndelivery being re-attempted in quick succession, using up valuable CPU and\nnetwork resources.\nDivert\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis diverts allow messages to be transparently \"diverted\"\nor copied from one address to another with just some simple configuration\ndefined on the server side.\nDurable Subscription\nThe durable-subscription example shows you how to use a durable subscription\nwith Apache ActiveMQ Artemis. Durable subscriptions are a standard part of JMS,\nplease consult the JMS 1.1 specification for full details.\nUnlike non-durable subscriptions, the key function of durable subscriptions is\nthat the messages contained in them persist longer than the lifetime of the\nsubscriber - i.e. they will accumulate messages sent to the topic even if there\nis no active subscriber on them. They will also survive server restarts or\ncrashes. Note that for the messages to be persisted, the messages sent to them\nmust be marked as durable messages.\nEmbedded\nThe embedded example shows how to embed a broker within your own code using\nPOJO instantiation and no config files.\nEmbedded Simple\nThe embedded-simple example shows how to embed a broker within your own code\nusing regular Apache ActiveMQ Artemis XML files.\nExclusive Queue\nThe exlusive-queue example shows you how to use exclusive queues, that route\nall messages to only one consumer at a time.\nMessage Expiration\nThe expiry example shows you how to define and deal with message expiration.\nMessages can be retained in the messaging system for a limited period of time\nbefore being removed. JMS specification states that clients should not receive\nmessages that have been expired (but it does not guarantee this will not\nhappen).\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis can assign an expiry address to a given queue so that\nwhen messages are expired, they are removed from the queue and sent to the\nexpiry address. These \"expired\" messages can later be consumed from the expiry\naddress for further inspection.\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis Resource Adapter example\nThis examples shows how to build the activemq resource adapters a rar for\ndeployment in other Application Server's\nHTTP Transport\nThe http-transport example shows you how to configure Apache ActiveMQ Artemis\nto use the HTTP protocol as its transport layer.\nInstantiate JMS Objects Directly\nUsually, JMS Objects such as ConnectionFactory, Queue and Topic instances\nare looked up from JNDI before being used by the client code.  This objects are\ncalled \"administered objects\" in JMS terminology.\nHowever, in some cases a JNDI server may not be available or desired. To come\nto the rescue Apache ActiveMQ Artemis also supports the direct instantiation of\nthese administered objects on the client side so you don't have to use JNDI for\nJMS.\nInterceptor\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis allows an application to use an interceptor to hook\ninto the messaging system. Interceptors allow you to handle various message\nevents in Apache ActiveMQ Artemis.\nInterceptor AMQP\nSimilar to the Interceptor example, but using AMQP interceptors.\nInterceptor Client\nSimilar to the Interceptor example, but using interceptors on\nthe client rather than the broker.\nInterceptor MQTT\nSimilar to the Interceptor example, but using MQTT interceptors.\nJAAS\nThe jaas example shows you how to configure Apache ActiveMQ Artemis to use\nJAAS for security. Apache ActiveMQ Artemis can leverage JAAS to delegate user\nauthentication and authorization to existing security infrastructure.\nJMS Auto Closable\nThe jms-auto-closeable example shows how JMS resources, such as connections,\nsessions and consumers, in JMS 2 can be automatically closed on error.\nJMS Completion Listener\nThe jms-completion-listener example shows how to send a message\nasynchronously to Apache ActiveMQ Artemis and use a CompletionListener to be\nnotified of the Broker receiving it.\nJMS Bridge\nThe jms-bridge example shows how to setup a bridge between two standalone\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis servers.\nJMS Context\nThe jms-context example shows how to send and receive a message to/from an\naddress/queue using Apache ActiveMQ Artemis by using a JMS Context.\nA JMSContext is part of JMS 2.0 and combines the JMS Connection and Session\nObjects into a simple Interface.\nJMS Shared Consumer\nThe jms-shared-consumer example shows you how can use shared consumers to\nshare a subscription on a topic. In JMS 1.1 this was not allowed and so caused\na scalability issue. In JMS 2 this restriction has been lifted so you can share\nthe load across different threads and connections.\nJMX Management\nThe jmx example shows how to manage Apache ActiveMQ Artemis using JMX.\nLarge Message\nThe large-message example shows you how to send and receive very large\nmessages with Apache ActiveMQ Artemis. Apache ActiveMQ Artemis supports the\nsending and receiving of huge messages, much larger than can fit in available\nRAM on the client or server. Effectively the only limit to message size is the\namount of disk space you have on the server.\nLarge messages are persisted on the server so they can survive a server\nrestart. In other words Apache ActiveMQ Artemis doesn't just do a simple socket\nstream from the sender to the consumer.\nLast-Value Queue\nThe last-value-queue example shows you how to define and deal with last-value\nqueues. Last-value queues are special queues which discard any messages when a\nnewer message with the same value for a well-defined last-value property is put\nin the queue. In other words, a last-value queue only retains the last value.\nA typical example for last-value queue is for stock prices, where you are only\ninterested by the latest price for a particular stock.\nManagement\nThe management example shows how to manage Apache ActiveMQ Artemis using JMS\nMessages to invoke management operations on the server.\nManagement Notification\nThe management-notification example shows how to receive management\nnotifications from Apache ActiveMQ Artemis using JMS messages. Apache ActiveMQ\nArtemis servers emit management notifications when events of interest occur\n(consumers are created or closed, addresses are created or deleted, security\nauthentication fails, etc.).\nMessage Counter\nThe message-counters example shows you how to use message counters to obtain\nmessage information for a queue.\nMessage Group\nThe message-group example shows you how to configure and use message groups\nwith Apache ActiveMQ Artemis. Message groups allow you to pin messages so they\nare only consumed by a single consumer. Message groups are sets of messages\nthat has the following characteristics:\n\nMessages in a message group share the same group id, i.e. they have same\nJMSXGroupID string property values\n\nThe consumer that receives the first message of a group will receive all the\nmessages that belongs to the group\n\n\nMessage Group\nThe message-group2 example shows you how to configure and use message groups\nwith Apache ActiveMQ Artemis via a connection factory.\nMessage Priority\nMessage Priority can be used to influence the delivery order for messages.\nIt can be retrieved by the message's standard header field 'JMSPriority' as\ndefined in JMS specification version 1.1.\nThe value is of type integer, ranging from 0 (the lowest) to 9 (the highest).\nWhen messages are being delivered, their priorities will effect their order of\ndelivery. Messages of higher priorities will likely be delivered before those\nof lower priorities.\nMessages of equal priorities are delivered in the natural order of their\narrival at their destinations. Please consult the JMS 1.1 specification for\nfull details.\nMultiple Failover\nThis example demonstrates how to set up a live server with multiple backups\nMultiple Failover Failback\nThis example demonstrates how to set up a live server with multiple backups but\nforcing failover back to the original live server\nNo Consumer Buffering\nBy default, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis consumers buffer messages from the server\nin a client side buffer before you actually receive them on the client side.\nThis improves performance since otherwise every time you called receive() or\nhad processed the last message in a MessageListener onMessage() method, the\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis client would have to go the server to request the next\nmessage, which would then get sent to the client side, if one was available.\nThis would involve a network round trip for every message and reduce\nperformance. Therefore, by default, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis pre-fetches\nmessages into a buffer on each consumer.\nIn some case buffering is not desirable, and Apache ActiveMQ Artemis allows it\nto be switched off. This example demonstrates that.\nNon-Transaction Failover With Server Data Replication\nThe non-transaction-failover example demonstrates two servers coupled as a\nlive-backup pair for high availability (HA), and a client using a\nnon-transacted JMS session failing over from live to backup when the live\nserver is crashed.\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis implements failover of client connections between live\nand backup servers. This is implemented by the replication of state between\nlive and backup nodes. When replication is configured and a live node crashes,\nthe client connections can carry and continue to send and consume messages.\nWhen non-transacted sessions are used, once and only once message delivery is\nnot guaranteed and it is possible that some messages will be lost or delivered\ntwice.\nOpenWire\nThe Openwire example shows how to configure an Apache ActiveMQ Artemis server\nto communicate with an Apache ActiveMQ Artemis JMS client that uses open-wire\nprotocol.\nYou will find the queue example for open wire, and the chat example. The virtual-topic-mapping examples shows how to\nmap the ActiveMQ 5.x Virtual Topic naming convention to work with the Artemis Address model.\nPaging\nThe paging example shows how Apache ActiveMQ Artemis can support huge queues\neven when the server is running in limited RAM. It does this by transparently\npaging messages to disk, and depaging them when they are required.\nPre-Acknowledge\nStandard JMS supports three acknowledgement modes:AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE,\nCLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE, and DUPS_OK_ACKNOWLEDGE. For a full description on\nthese modes please consult the JMS specification, or any JMS tutorial.\nAll of these standard modes involve sending acknowledgements from the client to\nthe server. However in some cases, you really don't mind losing messages in\nevent of failure, so it would make sense to acknowledge the message on the\nserver before delivering it to the client. This example demonstrates how Apache\nActiveMQ Artemis allows this with an extra acknowledgement mode.\nMessage Producer Rate Limiting\nThe producer-rte-limit example demonstrates how, with Apache ActiveMQ\nArtemis, you can specify a maximum send rate at which a JMS message producer\nwill send messages.\nQueue\nA simple example demonstrating a queue.\nMessage Redistribution\nThe queue-message-redistribution example demonstrates message redistribution\nbetween queues with the same name deployed in different nodes of a cluster.\nQueue Requestor\nA simple example demonstrating a JMS queue requestor.\nQueue with Message Selector\nThe queue-selector example shows you how to selectively consume messages\nusing message selectors with queue consumers.\nReattach Node example\nThe Reattach Node example shows how a client can try to reconnect to the same\nserver instead of failing the connection immediately and notifying any user\nExceptionListener objects. Apache ActiveMQ Artemis can be configured to\nautomatically retry the connection, and reattach to the server when it becomes\navailable again across the network.\nReplicated Failback example\nAn example showing how failback works when using replication, In this example a\nlive server will replicate all its Journal to a backup server as it updates it.\nWhen the live server crashes the backup takes over from the live server and the\nclient reconnects and carries on from where it left off.\nReplicated Failback static example\nAn example showing how failback works when using replication, but this time\nwith static connectors\nReplicated multiple failover example\nAn example showing how to configure multiple backups when using replication\nReplicated Failover transaction example\nAn example showing how failover works with a transaction when using replication\nRequest-Reply example\nA simple example showing the JMS request-response pattern.\nScheduled Message\nThe scheduled-message example shows you how to send a scheduled message to an\naddress/queue with Apache ActiveMQ Artemis. Scheduled messages won't get\ndelivered until a specified time in the future.\nSecurity\nThe security example shows you how configure and use role based security with\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis.\nSecurity LDAP\nThe security-ldap example shows you how configure and use role based security\nwith Apache ActiveMQ Artemis & an embedded instance of the Apache DS LDAP\nserver.\nSend Acknowledgements\nThe send-acknowledgements example shows you how to use Apache ActiveMQ\nArtemis's advanced asynchronous send acknowledgements feature to obtain\nacknowledgement from the server that sends have been received and processed in\na separate stream to the sent messages.\nSlow Consumer\nThe slow-consumer example shows you how to detect slow consumers and\nconfigure a slow consumer policy in Apache ActiveMQ Artemis's\nSpring Integration\nThis example shows how to use embedded JMS using Apache ActiveMQ Artemis's\nSpring integration.\nSSL Transport\nThe ssl-enabled shows you how to configure SSL with Apache ActiveMQ Artemis\nto send and receive message.\nStatic Message Selector\nThe static-selector example shows you how to configure an Apache ActiveMQ\nArtemis core queue with static message selectors (filters).\nStatic Message Selector Using JMS\nThe static-selector-jms example shows you how to configure an Apache ActiveMQ\nArtemis queue with static message selectors (filters) using JMS.\nStomp\nThe stomp example shows you how to configure an Apache ActiveMQ Artemis\nserver to send and receive Stomp messages.\nStomp1.1\nThe stomp example shows you how to configure an Apache ActiveMQ Artemis\nserver to send and receive Stomp messages via a Stomp 1.1 connection.\nStomp1.2\nThe stomp example shows you how to configure an Apache ActiveMQ Artemis\nserver to send and receive Stomp messages via a Stomp 1.2 connection.\nStomp Over Web Sockets\nThe stomp-websockets example shows you how to configure an Apache ActiveMQ\nArtemis server to send and receive Stomp messages directly from Web browsers\n(provided they support Web Sockets).\nSymmetric Cluster\nThe symmetric-cluster example demonstrates a symmetric cluster set-up with\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis.\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis has extremely flexible clustering which allows you to\nset-up servers in many different topologies. The most common topology that\nyou'll perhaps be familiar with if you are used to application server\nclustering is a symmetric cluster.\nWith a symmetric cluster, the cluster is homogeneous, i.e. each node is\nconfigured the same as every other node, and every node is connected to every\nother node in the cluster.\nTemporary Queue\nA simple example demonstrating how to use a JMS temporary queue.\nTopic\nA simple example demonstrating a JMS topic.\nTopic Hierarchy\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis supports topic hierarchies. With a topic hierarchy you\ncan register a subscriber with a wild-card and that subscriber will receive any\nmessages sent to an address that matches the wild card.\nTopic Selector 1\nThe topic-selector-example1 example shows you how to send message to a JMS\nTopic, and subscribe them using selectors with Apache ActiveMQ Artemis.\nTopic Selector 2\nThe topic-selector-example2 example shows you how to selectively consume\nmessages using message selectors with topic consumers.\nTransaction Failover\nThe transaction-failover example demonstrates two servers coupled as a\nlive-backup pair for high availability (HA), and a client using a transacted\nJMS session failing over from live to backup when the live server is crashed.\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis implements failover of client connections between live\nand backup servers. This is implemented by the sharing of a journal between the\nservers. When a live node crashes, the client connections can carry and\ncontinue to send and consume messages. When transacted sessions are used, once\nand only once message delivery is guaranteed.\nFailover Without Transactions\nThe stop-server-failover example demonstrates failover of the JMS connection\nfrom one node to another when the live server crashes using a JMS\nnon-transacted session.\nTransactional Session\nThe transactional example shows you how to use a transactional Session with\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis.\nXA Heuristic\nThe xa-heuristic example shows you how to make an XA heuristic decision\nthrough Apache ActiveMQ Artemis Management Interface. A heuristic decision is a\nunilateral decision to commit or rollback an XA transaction branch after it has\nbeen prepared.\nXA Receive\nThe xa-receive example shows you how message receiving behaves in an XA\ntransaction in Apache ActiveMQ Artemis.\nXA Send\nThe xa-send example shows you how message sending behaves in an XA\ntransaction in Apache ActiveMQ Artemis.\n"},"wildcard-routing.html":{"url":"wildcard-routing.html","title":"Routing Messages With Wild Cards","keywords":"","body":"Routing Messages With Wild Cards\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis allows the routing of messages via wildcard addresses.\nIf a queue is created with an address of say queue.news.# then it will\nreceive any messages sent to addresses that match this, for instance\nqueue.news.europe or queue.news.usa or queue.news.usa.sport.

For documentation on JMS selector syntax\nplease the JMS javadoc for\njavax.jms.Message.\nFilter expressions are used in several places in Apache ActiveMQ Artemis\n\nPredefined Queues. When pre-defining a queue, in\nbroker.xml in either the core or jms configuration a filter\nexpression can be defined for a queue. Only messages that match the\nfilter expression will enter the queue.\n\nCore bridges can be defined with an optional filter expression, only\nmatching messages will be bridged (see Core Bridges).\n\nDiverts can be defined with an optional filter expression, only\nmatching messages will be diverted (see Diverts).\n\nFilter are also used programmatically when creating consumers,\nqueues and in several places as described in management.\n\n\nThere are some differences between JMS selector expressions and Apache ActiveMQ Artemis\ncore filter expressions. Whereas JMS selector expressions operate on a\nJMS message, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis core filter expressions operate on a core message.\nThe following identifiers can be used in a core filter expressions to\nrefer to attributes of the core message in an expression:\n\nAMQPriority. To refer to the priority of a message. Message\npriorities are integers with valid values from 0 - 9. 0 is the\nlowest priority and 9 is the highest. E.g.\nAMQPriority = 3 AND animal = 'aardvark'\n\nAMQExpiration. To refer to the expiration time of a message. The\nvalue is a long integer.\n\nAMQDurable. To refer to whether a message is durable or not. The\nvalue is a string with valid values: DURABLE or NON_DURABLE.\n\nAMQTimestamp. The timestamp of when the message was created. The\nvalue is a long integer.\n\nAMQSize. The size of a message in bytes. The value is an integer.\n\n\nAny other identifiers used in core filter expressions will be assumed to\nbe properties of the message.\nThe JMS spec states that a String property should not get converted to a \nnumeric when used in a selector. So for example, if a message has the age \nproperty set to String 21 then the following selector should not match \nit: age > 18. Since Apache ActiveMQ Artemis supports STOMP clients which\ncan only send messages with string properties, that restriction is a bit \nlimiting. Therefore, if you want your filter expressions to auto-convert String \nproperties to the appropriate number type, just prefix it with\nconvert_string_expressions:. If you changed the filter expression in the\nprevious example to be convert_string_expressions:age > 18, then it would \nmatch the aforementioned message.\nThe JMS spec also states that property identifiers (and therefore the\nidentifiers which are valid for use in a filter expression) are an, \n\"unlimited-length sequence of letters and digits, the first of which must be\na letter. A letter is any character for which the method \nCharacter.isJavaLetter returns true. This includes _ and $. A letter\nor digit is any character for which the method Character.isJavaLetterOrDigit\nreturns true.\" This constraint means that hyphens (i.e. -) cannot be used.\nHowever, this constraint can be overcome by using the hyphenated_props: \nprefix. For example, if a message had the foo-bar property set to 0 then\nthe filter expression hyphenated_props:foo-bar = 0 would match it.\n"},"persistence.html":{"url":"persistence.html","title":"Persistence","keywords":"","body":"Persistence\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis ships with two persistence options.  The file journal which is \nhighly optimized for the messaging use case and gives great performance, and also the\nJDBC Store, which uses JDBC to connect to a database of your choice.

It consists of a set of\nfiles on disk. Each file is pre-created to a fixed size and initially\nfilled with padding. As operations are performed on the server, e.g. add\nmessage, update message, delete message, records are appended to the\njournal. When one journal file is full we move to the next one.\nBecause records are only appended, i.e. added to the end of the journal\nwe minimise disk head movement, i.e. we minimise random access\noperations which is typically the slowest operation on a disk.\nMaking the file size configurable means that an optimal size can be\nchosen, i.e. making each file fit on a disk cylinder. Modern disk\ntopologies are complex and we are not in control over which cylinder(s)\nthe file is mapped onto so this is not an exact science. But by\nminimising the number of disk cylinders the file is using, we can\nminimise the amount of disk head movement, since an entire disk cylinder\nis accessible simply by the disk rotating - the head does not have to\nmove.\nAs delete records are added to the journal, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis has a sophisticated\nfile garbage collection algorithm which can determine if a particular\njournal file is needed any more - i.e. has all its data been deleted in\nthe same or other files. If so, the file can be reclaimed and re-used.\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis also has a compaction algorithm which removes dead space from\nthe journal and compresses up the data so it takes up less files on\ndisk.\nThe journal also fully supports transactional operation if required,\nsupporting both local and XA transactions.\nThe majority of the journal is written in Java, however we abstract out\nthe interaction with the actual file system to allow different pluggable\nimplementations. Apache ActiveMQ Artemis ships with two implementations:\nJava NIO\nThe first implementation uses standard Java NIO to interface with\nthe file system. This provides extremely good performance and runs\non any platform where there's a Java 6+ runtime.\nLinux Asynchronous IO\nThe second implementation uses a thin native code wrapper to talk to\nthe Linux asynchronous IO library (AIO). With AIO, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis will be\ncalled back when the data has made it to disk, allowing us to avoid\nexplicit syncs altogether and simply send back confirmation of\ncompletion when AIO informs us that the data has been persisted.\nUsing AIO will typically provide even better performance than using Java NIO.\nThis journal option is only available when running Linux kernel 2.6 or\nlater and after having installed libaio (if it's not already\ninstalled). For instructions on how to install libaio please see Installing AIO section.\nAlso, please note that AIO will only work with the following file\nsystems: ext2, ext3, ext4, jfs, xfs and NFSV4.\nFor more information on libaio please see lib AIO.\nlibaio is part of the kernel project.\nMemory mapped\nThe third implementation uses a file-backed READ_WRITE\nmemory mapping against the OS page cache to interface with the file system.\nThis provides extremely good performance (especially under strictly process failure durability requirements), \nalmost zero copy (actually is the kernel page cache) and zero garbage (from the Java HEAP perspective) operations and runs \non any platform where there's a Java 4+ runtime.\nUnder power failure durability requirements it will perform at least on par with the NIO journal with the only \nexception of Linux OS with kernel less or equals 2.6, in which the msync) implementation necessary to ensure \ndurable writes was different (and slower) from the fsync used is case of NIO journal.\nIt benefits by the configuration of OS huge pages,\nin particular when is used a big number of journal files and sizing them as multiple of the OS page size in bytes.  \nStandard Files\nThe standard Apache ActiveMQ Artemis core server uses two instances of the journal:\n\nBindings journal.\nThis journal is used to store bindings related data. That includes\nthe set of queues that are deployed on the server and their\nattributes. It also stores data such as id sequence counters.\nThe bindings journal is always a NIO journal as it is typically low\nthroughput compared to the message journal.\nThe files on this journal are prefixed as activemq-bindings. Each\nfile has a bindings extension. File size is 1048576, and it is\nlocated at the bindings folder.\n\nMessage journal.\nThis journal instance stores all message related data, including the\nmessage themselves and also duplicate-id caches.\nBy default Apache ActiveMQ Artemis will try and use an AIO journal. If AIO is not\navailable, e.g. the platform is not Linux with the correct kernel\nversion or AIO has not been installed then it will automatically\nfall back to using Java NIO which is available on any Java platform.\nThe files on this journal are prefixed as activemq-data. Each file\nhas an amq extension. File size is by the default 10485760\n(configurable), and it is located at the journal folder.\n\n\nFor large messages, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis persists them outside the message journal.\nThis is discussed in Large Messages.\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis can also be configured to page messages to disk in low memory\nsituations. This is discussed in Paging.\nIf no persistence is required at all, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis can also be configured\nnot to persist any data at all to storage as discussed in the Configuring\nthe broker for Zero Persistence section.\nConfiguring the bindings journal\nThe bindings journal is configured using the following attributes in\nbroker.xml\n\nbindings-directory\nThis is the directory in which the bindings journal lives. The\ndefault value is data/bindings.\n\ncreate-bindings-dir\nIf this is set to true then the bindings directory will be\nautomatically created at the location specified in\nbindings-directory if it does not already exist. The default value\nis true\n\n\nConfiguring the jms journal\nThe jms config shares its configuration with the bindings journal.\nConfiguring the message journal\nThe message journal is configured using the following attributes in\nbroker.xml\n\njournal-directory\nThis is the directory in which the message journal lives. The\ndefault value is data/journal.\nFor the best performance, we recommend the journal is located on its\nown physical volume in order to minimise disk head movement. If the\njournal is on a volume which is shared with other processes which\nmight be writing other files (e.g. bindings journal, database, or\ntransaction coordinator) then the disk head may well be moving\nrapidly between these files as it writes them, thus drastically\nreducing performance.\nWhen the message journal is stored on a SAN we recommend each\njournal instance that is stored on the SAN is given its own LUN\n(logical unit).\n\nnode-manager-lock-directory\n This is the directory in which the node manager file lock lives. By default\n has the same value of journal-directory.\n This is useful when the message journal is on a SAN and is being used a Shared Store HA\n policy with the broker instances on the same physical machine.\n\ncreate-journal-dir\nIf this is set to true then the journal directory will be\nautomatically created at the location specified in\njournal-directory if it does not already exist. The default value\nis true\n\njournal-type\nValid values are NIO, ASYNCIO or MAPPED.\nChoosing NIO chooses the Java NIO journal. Choosing ASYNCIO chooses\nthe Linux asynchronous IO journal. If you choose ASYNCIO but are not\nrunning Linux or you do not have libaio installed then Apache ActiveMQ Artemis will\ndetect this and automatically fall back to using NIO.\nChoosing MAPPED chooses the Java Memory Mapped journal.\n\njournal-sync-transactional\nIf this is set to true then Apache ActiveMQ Artemis will make sure all transaction\ndata is flushed to disk on transaction boundaries (commit, prepare\nand rollback). The default value is true.\n\njournal-sync-non-transactional\nIf this is set to true then Apache ActiveMQ Artemis will make sure non\ntransactional message data (sends and acknowledgements) are flushed\nto disk each time. The default value for this is true.\n\njournal-file-size\nThe size of each journal file in bytes. The default value for this\nis 10485760 bytes (10MiB).\n\njournal-min-files\nThe minimum number of files the journal will maintain. When Apache ActiveMQ Artemis\nstarts and there is no initial message data, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis will\npre-create journal-min-files number of files.\nCreating journal files and filling them with padding is a fairly\nexpensive operation and we want to minimise doing this at run-time\nas files get filled. By pre-creating files, as one is filled the\njournal can immediately resume with the next one without pausing to\ncreate it.\nDepending on how much data you expect your queues to contain at\nsteady state you should tune this number of files to match that\ntotal amount of data.\n\njournal-pool-files\nThe system will create as many files as needed however when reclaiming files\nit will shrink back to the journal-pool-files.\nThe default to this parameter is -1, meaning it will never delete files on the journal once created.\nNotice that the system can't grow infinitely as you are still required to use paging for destinations that can\ngrow indefinitely.\nNotice: in case you get too many files you can use compacting.\n\njournal-max-io\nWrite requests are queued up before being submitted to the system\nfor execution. This parameter controls the maximum number of write\nrequests that can be in the IO queue at any one time. If the queue\nbecomes full then writes will block until space is freed up.\nWhen using NIO, this value should always be equal to 1\nWhen using ASYNCIO, the default should be 500.\nThe system maintains different defaults for this parameter depending\non whether it's NIO or ASYNCIO (default for NIO is 1, default for ASYNCIO is\n500)\nThere is a limit and the total max ASYNCIO can't be higher than what is\nconfigured at the OS level (/proc/sys/fs/aio-max-nr) usually at\n65536.\n\njournal-buffer-timeout\nInstead of flushing on every write that requires a flush, we\nmaintain an internal buffer, and flush the entire buffer either when\nit is full, or when a timeout expires, whichever is sooner. This is\nused for both NIO and ASYNCIO and allows the system to scale better with\nmany concurrent writes that require flushing.\nThis parameter controls the timeout at which the buffer will be\nflushed if it hasn't filled already. ASYNCIO can typically cope with a\nhigher flush rate than NIO, so the system maintains different\ndefaults for both NIO and ASYNCIO (default for NIO is 3333333\nnanoseconds - 300 times per second, default for ASYNCIO is 500000\nnanoseconds - ie. 2000 times per second).\nSetting this property to 0 will disable the internal buffer and writes will\nbe directly written to the journal file immediately.\n\nNote:\nBy increasing the timeout, you may be able to increase system\nthroughput at the expense of latency, the default parameters are\nchosen to give a reasonable balance between throughput and\nlatency.\n\n\njournal-buffer-size\nThe size of the timed buffer on ASYNCIO. The default value is 490KiB.\n\njournal-compact-min-files\nThe minimal number of files before we can consider compacting the\njournal. The compacting algorithm won't start until you have at\nleast journal-compact-min-files\nSetting this to 0 will disable the feature to compact completely.\nThis could be dangerous though as the journal could grow indefinitely.\nUse it wisely!\nThe default for this parameter is 10\n\njournal-compact-percentage\nThe threshold to start compacting. When less than this percentage is\nconsidered live data, we start compacting. Note also that compacting\nwon't kick in until you have at least journal-compact-min-files\ndata files on the journal\nThe default for this parameter is 30\n\njournal-datasync (default: true)\nThis will disable the use of fdatasync on journal writes.\nWhen enabled it ensures full power failure durability, otherwise \nprocess failure durability on journal writes (OS guaranteed).\nThis is particular effective for NIO and MAPPED journals, which rely on \n fsync/msync to force write changes to disk.\n\n\nNote on disabling journal-datasync\n\nAny modern OS guarantees that on process failures (i.e. crash) all the uncommitted changes\nto the page cache will be flushed to the file system, maintaining coherence between \nsubsequent operations against the same pages and ensuring that no data will be lost.\nThe predictability of the timing of such flushes, in case of a disabled journal-datasync,\ndepends on the OS configuration, but without compromising (or relaxing) the process \nfailure durability semantics as described above.\nRely on the OS page cache sacrifice the power failure protection, while increasing the \neffectiveness of the journal operations, capable of exploiting \nthe read caching and write combining features provided by the OS's kernel page cache subsystem.\n\nNote on disabling disk write cache\n\nWarning\nMost disks contain hardware write caches. A write cache can increase\nthe apparent performance of the disk because writes just go into the\ncache and are then lazily written to the disk later.\nThis happens irrespective of whether you have executed a fsync() from\nthe operating system or correctly synced data from inside a Java\nprogram!\nBy default many systems ship with disk write cache enabled. This means\nthat even after syncing from the operating system there is no\nguarantee the data has actually made it to disk, so if a failure\noccurs, critical data can be lost.\nSome more expensive disks have non volatile or battery backed write\ncaches which won't necessarily lose data on event of failure, but you\nneed to test them!\nIf your disk does not have an expensive non volatile or battery backed\ncache and it's not part of some kind of redundant array (e.g. RAID),\nand you value your data integrity you need to make sure disk write\ncache is disabled.\nBe aware that disabling disk write cache can give you a nasty shock\nperformance wise. If you've been used to using disks with write cache\nenabled in their default setting, unaware that your data integrity\ncould be compromised, then disabling it will give you an idea of how\nfast your disk can perform when acting really reliably.\nOn Linux you can inspect and/or change your disk's write cache\nsettings using the tools hdparm (for IDE disks) or sdparm or\nsginfo (for SDSI/SATA disks)\nOn Windows you can check / change the setting by right clicking on the\ndisk and clicking properties.\n\nInstalling AIO\nThe Java NIO journal gives great performance, but If you are running\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis using Linux Kernel 2.6 or later, we highly recommend you use\nthe ASYNCIO journal for the very best persistence performance.\nIt's not possible to use the ASYNCIO journal under other operating systems\nor earlier versions of the Linux kernel.\nIf you are running Linux kernel 2.6 or later and don't already have\nlibaio installed, you can easily install it using the following steps:\nUsing yum, (e.g. on Fedora or Red Hat Enterprise Linux):\nyum install libaio\n\nUsing aptitude, (e.g. on Ubuntu or Debian system):\napt-get install libaio\n\nJDBC Persistence\nWARNING: The Apache ActiveMQ Artemis JDBC persistence store is under development and is included for evaluation purposes.\nThe Apache ActiveMQ Artemis JDBC persistence layer offers the ability to store broker state (Messages, Addresses and other\napplication state) using a database.  N.B. Address full policy Paging (See: The section on Paging) is currently not\nsupported with the JDBC persistence layer.\nUsing the ActiveMQ Artemis File Journal is the recommended configuration as it offers higher levels of performance and is\nmore mature.  The JDBC persistence layer is targeted to those users who must use a database e.g. due to internal company\npolicy.\nActiveMQ Artemis currently has support for a limited number of database vendors (older versions may work but mileage may\nvary):\n\nPostgreSQL 9.4.x\nMySQL 5.7.x\nApache Derby 10.11.1.1\n\nThe JDBC store uses a JDBC connection to store messages and bindings data in records in database tables.  The data stored\nin the database tables is encoded using Apache ActiveMQ Artemis internal encodings.\nConfiguring JDBC Persistence\nTo configure Apache ActiveMQ Artemis to use a database for persisting messages and bindings data you must do two things.\n\nSee the documentation on adding runtime dependencies to \nunderstand how to make the JDBC driver available to the broker.\n\nCreate a store element in your broker.xml config file under the  element.  For example:\n\n\n\n   \n      jdbc:derby:data/derby/database-store;create=true\n      BINDINGS_TABLE\n      MESSAGE_TABLE\n      MESSAGE_TABLE\n      LARGE_MESSAGES_TABLE\n      NODE_MANAGER_TABLE\n      org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedDriver\n   \n\n\n\njdbc-connection-url\nThe full JDBC connection URL for your database server.  The connection url should include all configuration parameters and database name.  Note: When configuring the server using the XML configuration files please ensure to escape any illegal chars; \"&\" for example, is typical in JDBC connection url and should be escaped to \"&\".\n\nbindings-table-name\nThe name of the table in which bindings data will be persisted for the ActiveMQ Artemis server.  Specifying table names allows users to share single database amongst multiple servers, without interference.\n\nmessage-table-name\nThe name of the table in which bindings data will be persisted for the ActiveMQ Artemis server.  Specifying table names allows users to share single database amongst multiple servers, without interference.\n\nlarge-message-table-name\nThe name of the table in which messages and related data will be persisted for the ActiveMQ Artemis server.  Specifying table names allows users to share single database amongst multiple servers, without interference.\n\npage-store-table-name\nThe name of the table to house the page store directory information.  Note that each address will have its own page table which will use this name appended with a unique id of up to 20 characters.\n\nnode-manager-store-table-name\nThe name of the table in which the HA Shared Store locks (ie live and backup) and HA related data will be persisted for the ActiveMQ Artemis server.  Specifying table names allows users to share single database amongst multiple servers, without interference.\nEach Shared Store live/backup pairs must use the same table name and isn't supported to share the same table between multiple (and unrelated) live/backup pairs.\n\njdbc-driver-class-name\nThe fully qualified class name of the desired database Driver.\n\njdbc-network-timeout\nThe JDBC network connection timeout in milliseconds. The default value\nis 20000 milliseconds (ie 20 seconds).\nWhen using a shared store it is recommended to set it less then or equal to jdbc-lock-expiration.\n\njdbc-lock-renew-period\nThe period in milliseconds of the keep alive service of a JDBC lock. The default value\nis 2000 milliseconds (ie 2 seconds).\n\njdbc-lock-expiration\nThe time in milliseconds a JDBC lock is considered valid without keeping it alive. The default value\nis 20000 milliseconds (ie 20 seconds).\n\njdbc-journal-sync-period\nThe time in milliseconds the journal will be synced with JDBC. The default value is 5 milliseconds.\n\n\nNote that some DBMS (e.g. Oracle, 30 chars) have restrictions on the size of table names, this should be taken into consideration when configuring table names for the Artemis database store, pay particular attention to the page store table name, which can be appended with a unique ID of up to 20 characters.  (for Oracle this would mean configuring a page-store-table-name of max size of 10 chars).\nIt is also possible to explicitly add the user and password rather than in the JDBC url if you need to encode it, this would look like:\n\n   \n      jdbc:derby:data/derby/database-store;create=true\n      ENC(dasfn353cewc)\n      ENC(ucwiurfjtew345)\n      BINDINGS_TABLE\n      MESSAGE_TABLE\n      MESSAGE_TABLE\n      LARGE_MESSAGES_TABLE\n      NODE_MANAGER_TABLE\n      org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedDriver\n   \n\n\nZero Persistence\nIn some situations, zero persistence is sometimes required for a\nmessaging system. Configuring Apache ActiveMQ Artemis to perform zero persistence is\nstraightforward. Simply set the parameter persistence-enabled in\nbroker.xml to false.\nPlease note that if you set this parameter to false, then zero\npersistence will occur. That means no bindings data, message data, large\nmessage data, duplicate id caches or paging data will be persisted.\n"},"configuring-transports.html":{"url":"configuring-transports.html","title":"Configuring Transports","keywords":"","body":"Configuring the Transport\nIn this chapter we'll describe the concepts required for understanding Apache\nActiveMQ Artemis transports and where and how they're configured.\nAcceptors\nOne of the most important concepts in Apache ActiveMQ Artemis transports is the\nacceptor. Let's dive straight in and take a look at an acceptor defined in\nxml in the configuration file broker.xml.\ntcp://localhost:61617\n\nAcceptors are always defined inside an acceptors element. There can be one or\nmore acceptors defined in the acceptors element. There's no upper limit to\nthe number of acceptors per server.\nEach acceptor defines a way in which connections can be made to the Apache\nActiveMQ Artemis server.\nIn the above example we're defining an acceptor that uses\nNetty to listen for connections at port 61617.\nThe acceptor element contains a URL that defines the kind of Acceptor to\ncreate along with its configuration. The schema part of the URL defines the\nAcceptor type which can either be tcp or vm which is Netty or an In VM\nAcceptor respectively. For Netty the host and the port of the URL define\nwhat host and port the acceptor will bind to. For In VM the Authority part\nof the URL defines a unique server id.\nThe acceptor can also be configured with a set of key=value pairs used to\nconfigure the specific transport, the set of valid key=value pairs depends on\nthe specific transport be used and are passed straight through to the\nunderlying transport. These are set on the URL as part of the query, like so:\ntcp://localhost:61617?sslEnabled=true&keyStorePath=/path\n\nConnectors\nWhereas acceptors are used on the server to define how we accept connections,\nconnectors are used to define how to connect to a server.\nLet's look at a connector defined in our broker.xml file:\ntcp://localhost:61617\n\nConnectors can be defined inside a connectors element. There can be one or\nmore connectors defined in the connectors element. There's no upper limit to\nthe number of connectors per server.\nA connector is used when the server acts as a client itself, e.g.:\n\nWhen one server is bridged to another\nWhen a server takes part in a cluster\n\nIn these cases the server needs to know how to connect to other servers.\nThat's defined by connectors.\nConfiguring the Transport Directly from the Client\nHow do we configure a core ClientSessionFactory with the information that it\nneeds to connect with a server?\nConnectors are also used indirectly when configuring a core\nClientSessionFactory to directly talk to a server. Although in this case\nthere's no need to define such a connector in the server side configuration,\ninstead we just specify the appropriate URI.\nHere's an example of creating a ClientSessionFactory which will connect\ndirectly to the acceptor we defined earlier in this chapter, it uses the\nstandard Netty TCP transport and will try and connect on port 61617 to\nlocalhost (default):\nServerLocator locator = ActiveMQClient.createServerLocator(\"tcp://localhost:61617\");\n\nClientSessionFactory sessionFactory = locator.createClientSessionFactory();\n\nClientSession session = sessionFactory.createSession(...);\n\nSimilarly, if you're using JMS, you can configure the JMS connection factory\ndirectly on the client side:\nConnectionFactory connectionFactory = new ActiveMQConnectionFactory(\"tcp://localhost:61617\");\n\nConnection jmsConnection = connectionFactory.createConnection();\n\nConfiguring the Netty transport\nOut of the box, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis currently uses\nNetty, a high performance low level network library.\nOur Netty transport can be configured in several different ways; to use\nstraightforward TCP sockets, SSL, or to tunnel over HTTP or HTTPS..\nWe believe this caters for the vast majority of transport requirements.\nSingle Port Support\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis supports using a single port for all protocols, Apache\nActiveMQ Artemis will automatically detect which protocol is being used CORE,\nAMQP, STOMP, MQTT or OPENWIRE and use the appropriate Apache ActiveMQ Artemis\nhandler. It will also detect whether protocols such as HTTP or Web Sockets are\nbeing used and also use the appropriate decoders. Web Sockets are supported for\nAMQP, STOMP, and MQTT.\nIt is possible to limit which protocols are supported by using the protocols\nparameter on the Acceptor like so:\ntcp://localhost:61617?protocols=CORE,AMQP\n\nConfiguring Netty TCP\nNetty TCP is a simple unencrypted TCP sockets based transport. If you're\nrunning connections across an untrusted network please bear in mind this\ntransport is unencrypted. You may want to look at the SSL or HTTPS\nconfigurations.\nWith the Netty TCP transport all connections are initiated from the client side\n(i.e. the server does not initiate any connections to the client). This works\nwell with firewall policies that typically only allow connections to be\ninitiated in one direction.\nAll the valid keys for the tcp URL scheme used for Netty are defined in the\nclass\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.core.remoting.impl.netty.TransportConstants.\nMost parameters can be used either with acceptors or connectors, some only work\nwith acceptors. The following parameters can be used to configure Netty for\nsimple TCP:\n\nNote:\nThe host and port parameters are only used in the core API, in XML\nconfiguration these are set in the URI host and port.\n\n\nhost. This specifies the host name or IP address to connect to (when\nconfiguring a connector) or to listen on (when configuring an acceptor). The\ndefault value for this property is localhost. When configuring acceptors,\nmultiple hosts or IP addresses can be specified by separating them with commas.\nIt is also possible to specify 0.0.0.0 to accept connection from all the\nhost's network interfaces. It's not valid to specify multiple addresses when\nspecifying the host for a connector; a connector makes a connection to one\nspecific address.\n\nNote:\nDon't forget to specify a host name or IP address! If you want your server\nable to accept connections from other nodes you must specify a hostname or\nIP address at which the acceptor will bind and listen for incoming\nconnections. The default is localhost which of course is not accessible\nfrom remote nodes!\n\n\nport. This specified the port to connect to (when configuring a connector)\nor to listen on (when configuring an acceptor). The default value for this\nproperty is 61616.\n\ntcpNoDelay. If this is true then Nagle's\nalgorithm will be\ndisabled. This is a Java (client) socket\noption.\nThe default value for this property is true.\n\ntcpSendBufferSize. This parameter determines the size of the TCP send\nbuffer in bytes. The default value for this property is 32768 bytes\n(32KiB).\nTCP buffer sizes should be tuned according to the bandwidth and latency of\nyour network. Here's a good link that explains the theory behind\nthis.\nIn summary TCP send/receive buffer sizes should be calculated as:\nbuffer_size = bandwidth * RTT.\nWhere bandwidth is in bytes per second and network round trip time (RTT) is\nin seconds. RTT can be easily measured using the ping utility.\nFor fast networks you may want to increase the buffer sizes from the\ndefaults.\n\ntcpReceiveBufferSize. This parameter determines the size of the TCP receive\nbuffer in bytes. The default value for this property is 32768 bytes\n(32KiB).\n\nwriteBufferLowWaterMark. This parameter determines the low water mark of\nthe Netty write buffer. Once the number of bytes queued in the write buffer\nexceeded the high water mark and then dropped down below this value, Netty's\nchannel will start to be writable again. The default value for this property is\n32768 bytes (32KiB).\n\nwriteBufferHighWaterMark. This parameter determines the high water mark of\nthe Netty write buffer. If the number of bytes queued in the write buffer\nexceeds this value, Netty's channel will start to be not writable. The default\nvalue for this property is 131072 bytes (128KiB).\n\nbatchDelay. Before writing packets to the transport, Apache ActiveMQ\nArtemis can be configured to batch up writes for a maximum of batchDelay\nmilliseconds. This can increase overall throughput for very small messages. It\ndoes so at the expense of an increase in average latency for message transfer.\nThe default value for this property is 0 ms.\n\ndirectDeliver. When a message arrives on the server and is delivered to\nwaiting consumers, by default, the delivery is done on the same thread as\nthat on which the message arrived. This gives good latency in environments with\nrelatively small messages and a small number of consumers, but at the cost of\noverall throughput and scalability - especially on multi-core machines. If you\nwant the lowest latency and a possible reduction in throughput then you can use\nthe default value for directDeliver (i.e. true). If you are willing to take\nsome small extra hit on latency but want the highest throughput set\ndirectDeliver to false.\n\nnioRemotingThreads This is deprecated. It is replaced by remotingThreads,\nif you are using this please update your configuration\n\nremotingThreads. Apache ActiveMQ Artemis will, by default, use a number of\nthreads equal to three times the number of cores (or hyper-threads) as\nreported by Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors() for processing\nincoming packets. If you want to override this value, you can set the number of\nthreads by specifying this parameter. The default value for this parameter is\n-1 which means use the value from\nRuntime.getRuntime().availableProcessors() * 3.\n\nlocalAddress. When configured a Netty Connector it is possible to specify\nwhich local address the client will use when connecting to the remote\naddress. This is typically used in the Application Server or when running\nEmbedded to control which address is used for outbound connections. If the\nlocal-address is not set then the connector will use any local address\navailable\n\nlocalPort. When configured a Netty Connector it is possible to specify\nwhich local port the client will use when connecting to the remote address.\nThis is typically used in the Application Server or when running Embedded to\ncontrol which port is used for outbound connections. If the local-port default\nis used, which is 0, then the connector will let the system pick up an\nephemeral port. valid ports are 0 to 65535\n\nconnectionsAllowed. This is only valid for acceptors. It limits the number\nof connections which the acceptor will allow. When this limit is reached a\nDEBUG level message is issued to the log, and the connection is refused. The\ntype of client in use will determine what happens when the connection is\nrefused. In the case of a core client, it will result in a\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.api.core.ActiveMQConnectionTimedOutException.\n\nhandshake-timeout. Prevents an unauthorised client opening a large number\nof connections and just keeping them open. As connections each require a file\nhandle this consumes resources that are then unavailable to other clients. Once\nthe connection is authenticated, the usual rules can be enforced regarding\nresource consumption. Default value is set to 10 seconds. Each integer is valid\nvalue. When set value to zero or negative integer this feature is turned off.\nChanging value needs to restart server to take effect.\n\nautoStart. Determines whether or not an acceptor will start automatically\nwhen the broker is started. Default value is true.\n\n\nConfiguring Netty Native Transport\nNetty Native Transport support exists for selected OS platforms.  This allows\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis to use native sockets/io instead of Java NIO.\nThese Native transports add features specific to a particular platform,\ngenerate less garbage, and generally improve performance when compared to Java\nNIO based transport.\nBoth Clients and Server can benefit from this.\nCurrent Supported Platforms.\n\nLinux running 64bit JVM\nMacOS running 64bit JVM\n\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis will by default enable the corresponding native\ntransport if a supported platform is detected.\nIf running on an unsupported platform or any issues loading native libs, Apache\nActiveMQ Artemis will fallback onto Java NIO.\nLinux Native Transport\nOn supported Linux platforms Epoll is used, @see\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoll. \nThe following properties are specific to this native transport:\n\nuseEpoll enables the use of epoll if a supported linux platform is running\na 64bit JVM is detected.  Setting this to false will force the use of Java\nNIO instead of epoll. Default is true\n\nMacOS Native Transport\nOn supported MacOS platforms KQueue is used, @see\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kqueue. \nThe following properties are specific to this native transport:\n\nuseKQueue enables the use of kqueue if a supported MacOS platform running a\n64bit JVM is detected.  Setting this to false will force the use of Java\nNIO instead of kqueue. Default is true\n\nConfiguring Netty SSL\nNetty SSL is similar to the Netty TCP transport but it provides additional\nsecurity by encrypting TCP connections using the Secure Sockets Layer SSL\nPlease see the examples for a full working example of using Netty SSL.\nNetty SSL uses all the same properties as Netty TCP but adds the following\nadditional properties:\n\nsslContext\n\nA key that can be used in conjunction with org.apache.activemq.artemis.core.remoting.impl.ssl.CachingSSLContextFactory\nto cache created SSLContext and avoid recreating. Look Configuring a SSLContextFactory\nfor more details.\n\nsslEnabled\nMust be true to enable SSL. Default is false.\n\nkeyStorePath\nWhen used on an acceptor this is the path to the SSL key store on the\nserver which holds the server's certificates (whether self-signed or signed by\nan authority).\nWhen used on a connector this is the path to the client-side SSL key store\nwhich holds the client certificates. This is only relevant for a connector if\nyou are using 2-way SSL (i.e. mutual authentication). Although this value is\nconfigured on the server, it is downloaded and used by the client. If the\nclient needs to use a different path from that set on the server then it can\noverride the server-side setting by either using the customary\n\"javax.net.ssl.keyStore\" system property or the ActiveMQ-specific\n\"org.apache.activemq.ssl.keyStore\" system property. The ActiveMQ-specific\nsystem property is useful if another component on client is already making use\nof the standard, Java system property.\n\nkeyStorePassword\nWhen used on an acceptor this is the password for the server-side keystore.\nWhen used on a connector this is the password for the client-side keystore.\nThis is only relevant for a connector if you are using 2-way SSL (i.e. mutual\nauthentication). Although this value can be configured on the server, it is\ndownloaded and used by the client.  If the client needs to use a different\npassword from that set on the server then it can override the server-side\nsetting by either using the customary \"javax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword\" system\nproperty or the ActiveMQ-specific \"org.apache.activemq.ssl.keyStorePassword\"\nsystem property. The ActiveMQ-specific system property is useful if another\ncomponent on client is already making use of the standard, Java system\nproperty.\n\ntrustStorePath\nWhen used on an acceptor this is the path to the server-side SSL key store\nthat holds the keys of all the clients that the server trusts. This is only\nrelevant for an acceptor if you are using 2-way SSL (i.e. mutual\nauthentication).\nWhen used on a connector this is the path to the client-side SSL key store\nwhich holds the public keys of all the servers that the client trusts. Although\nthis value can be configured on the server, it is downloaded and used by the\nclient. If the client needs to use a different path from that set on the server\nthen it can override the server-side setting by either using the customary\n\"javax.net.ssl.trustStore\" system property or the ActiveMQ-specific\n\"org.apache.activemq.ssl.trustStore\" system property. The ActiveMQ-specific\nsystem property is useful if another component on client is already making use\nof the standard, Java system property.\n\ntrustStorePassword\nWhen used on an acceptor this is the password for the server-side trust\nstore. This is only relevant for an acceptor if you are using 2-way SSL (i.e.\nmutual authentication).\nWhen used on a connector this is the password for the client-side\ntruststore. Although this value can be configured on the server, it is\ndownloaded and used by the client. If the client needs to use a different\npassword from that set on the server then it can override the server-side\nsetting by either using the customary \"javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword\" system\nproperty or the ActiveMQ-specific \"org.apache.activemq.ssl.trustStorePassword\"\nsystem property. The ActiveMQ-specific system property is useful if another\ncomponent on client is already making use of the standard, Java system\nproperty.\n\nenabledCipherSuites\nWhether used on an acceptor or connector this is a comma separated list\nof cipher suites used for SSL communication. The default value is null which\nmeans the JVM's default will be used.\n\nenabledProtocols\nWhether used on an acceptor or connector this is a comma separated list\nof protocols used for SSL communication. The default value is null which\nmeans the JVM's default will be used.\n\nneedClientAuth\nThis property is only for an acceptor. It tells a client connecting to this\nacceptor that 2-way SSL is required. Valid values are true or false.\nDefault is false.\nNote: This property takes precedence over wantClientAuth and if its\nvalue is set to true then wantClientAuth will be ignored.\n\nwantClientAuth\nThis property is only for an acceptor. It tells a client connecting to this\nacceptor that 2-way SSL is requested but not required.  Valid values are true\nor false. Default is false. \nNote: If the property needClientAuth is set to true then that\nproperty will take precedence and this property will be ignored.\n\nverifyHost\nWhen used on an acceptor the CN of the connecting client's SSL\ncertificate will be compared to its hostname to verify they match. This is\nuseful only for 2-way SSL.\nWhen used on a connector the CN of the server's SSL certificate will be\ncompared to its hostname to verify they match. This is useful for both 1-way\nand 2-way SSL.\nValid values are true or false. Default is false.\n\ntrustAll\nWhen used on a connector the client will trust the provided server\ncertificate implicitly, regardless of any configured trust store.  Warning:\nThis setting is primarily for testing purposes only and should not be used in\nproduction.\nValid values are true or false. Default is false.\n\nforceSSLParameters\nWhen used on a connector any SSL settings that are set as parameters on the\nconnector will be used instead of JVM system properties including both\njavax.net.ssl and ActiveMQ system properties to configure the SSL context for\nthis connector.\nValid values are true or false. Default is false.\n\nuseDefaultSslContext\nOnly valid on a connector. Allows the connector to use the \"default\" SSL\ncontext (via SSLContext.getDefault()) which can be set programmatically by\nthe client (via SSLContext.setDefault(SSLContext)). If set to true all\nother SSL related parameters except for sslEnabled are ignored.\nValid values are true or false. Default is false.\n\nsslProvider\nUsed to change the SSL Provider between JDK and OPENSSL. The default is\nJDK.  If used with OPENSSL you can add netty-tcnative to your classpath\nto use the native installed openssl. This can be useful if you want to use\nspecial ciphersuite - elliptic curve combinations which are support through\nopenssl but not through the JDK provider. See\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_TLS_implementations for more\ninformation's.\n\nsniHost\nWhen used on an acceptor the sniHost is a regular expression used to\nmatch the server_name extension on\nincoming SSL connections. If the name doesn't match then the connection to\nthe acceptor will be rejected. A WARN message will be logged if this happens.\nIf the incoming connection doesn't include the server_name extension then\nthe connection will be accepted.\nWhen used on a connector the sniHost value is used for the server_name\nextension on the SSL connection.\n\ntrustManagerFactoryPlugin\nThis is valid on either an acceptor or connector. It defines the name\nof the class which implements org.apache.activemq.artemis.api.core.TrustManagerFactoryPlugin.\nThis is a simple interface with a single method which returns a\njavax.net.ssl.TrustManagerFactory. The TrustManagerFactory will be used\nwhen the underlying javax.net.ssl.SSLContext is initialized. This allows\nfine-grained customization of who/what the broker & client trusts.\nThis value takes precedence of all other SSL parameters which apply to the\ntrust manager (i.e. trustAll, truststoreProvider, truststorePath,\ntruststorePassword, crlPath).\nAny plugin specified will need to be placed on the\nbroker's classpath.\n\n\nConfiguring a SSLContextFactory\nIf you have a JDK provider you can configure which SSLContextFactory to use.\nCurrently we provide two implementations: \n\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.core.remoting.impl.ssl.DefaultSSLContextFactory\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.core.remoting.impl.ssl.CachingSSLContextFactory\nbut you can also add your own implementation of org.apache.activemq.artemis.spi.core.remoting.ssl.SSLContextFactory.\n\nThe implementations are loaded by a ServiceLoader, thus you need to declare your implementation in\na META-INF/services/org.apache.activemq.artemis.spi.core.remoting.ssl.SSLContextFactory file.\nIf several implementations are available, the one with the highest priority will be selected.\nSo for example, if you want to use org.apache.activemq.artemis.core.remoting.impl.ssl.CachingSSLContextFactory\nyou need to add a META-INF/services/org.apache.activemq.artemis.spi.core.remoting.ssl.SSLContextFactory file\nto your classpath with the content org.apache.activemq.artemis.core.remoting.impl.ssl.CachingSSLContextFactory.\nNote: This mechanism doesn't work if you have selected OPENSSL as provider.\nConfiguring Netty HTTP\nNetty HTTP tunnels packets over the HTTP protocol. It can be useful in\nscenarios where firewalls only allow HTTP traffic to pass.\nPlease see the examples for a full working example of using Netty HTTP.\nNetty HTTP uses the same properties as Netty TCP but adds the following\nadditional properties:\n\nhttpEnabled. This is now no longer needed. With single port support Apache\nActiveMQ Artemis will now automatically detect if http is being used and\nconfigure itself.\n\nhttpClientIdleTime. How long a client can be idle before sending an empty\nhttp request to keep the connection alive\n\nhttpClientIdleScanPeriod. How often, in milliseconds, to scan for idle\nclients\n\nhttpResponseTime. How long the server can wait before sending an empty http\nresponse to keep the connection alive\n\nhttpServerScanPeriod. How often, in milliseconds, to scan for clients\nneeding responses\n\nhttpRequiresSessionId. If true the client will wait after the first call\nto receive a session id. Used the http connector is connecting to servlet\nacceptor (not recommended)\n\n\nConfiguring Netty SOCKS Proxy\nAll these parameters are only applicable to a connector and/or client URL.\nNote: Using a loop-back address (e.g. localhost or 127.0.0.1) as the\ntarget of the connector or URL will circumvent the application of these\nconfiguration properties. In other words, no SOCKS proxy support will be\nconfigured even if these properties are set.\n\nsocksEnabled. Whether or not to enable SOCKS support on the connector.\n\nsocksHost. The name of the SOCKS server to use.\n\nsocksPort. The port of the SOCKS server to use.\n\nsocksVersion. The version of SOCKS to use. Must be an integer. Default is\n5.\n\nsocksUsername. The username to use when connecting to the socksHost.\n\nsocksPassword. The password to use when connecting to the socksHost. Only\napplicable if the socksVersion is 5.\n\nsocksRemoteDNS. Whether or not to create remote destination socket\nunresolved and disable DNS resolution. Default is false.\n\n\n"},"config-reload.html":{"url":"config-reload.html","title":"Configuration Reload","keywords":"","body":"Configuration Reload\nThe system will perform a periodic check on the configuration files, configured\nby configuration-file-refresh-period, with the default at 5000, in\nmilliseconds.\nOnce the configuration file is changed (broker.xml) the following modules will\nbe reloaded automatically:\n\nAddress Settings\nSecurity Settings\nDiverts\nAddresses & queues\n\nIf using modulised broker.xml ensure you also read Reloading modular configuration files\nNote:\nDeletion of Address's and Queue's, not auto created is controlled by Address Settings\n\nconfig-delete-addresses\n\nOFF (DEFAULT) - will not remove upon config reload.\nFORCE - will remove the address and its queues upon config reload, even if messages remains, losing the messages in the address & queues.\n\n\nconfig-delete-queues\n\nOFF (DEFAULT) - will not remove upon config reload.\nFORCE - will remove the queue upon config reload, even if messages remains, losing the messages in the queue.\n\n\n\nBy default both settings are OFF as such address & queues won't be removed upon\nreload, given the risk of losing messages.\nWhen OFF You may execute explicit CLI or Management operations to remove\naddress & queues.\nReloadable Parameters\nThe broker configuration file has 2 main parts,  and .

If these were not removed they would cause a\nresource leak on the server and over time this result in the server\nrunning out of memory or other resources.\nWe have to balance the requirement for cleaning up dead client resources\nwith the fact that sometimes the network between the client and the\nserver can fail and then come back, allowing the client to reconnect.\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis supports client reconnection, so we don't want to clean up\n\"dead\" server side resources too soon or this will prevent any client\nfrom reconnecting, as it won't be able to find its old sessions on the\nserver.\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis makes all of this configurable via a connection TTL.\nBasically, the TTL determines how long the server will keep a connection\nalive in the absence of any data arriving from the client. The client will\nautomatically send \"ping\" packets periodically to prevent the server from\nclosing it down. If the server doesn't receive any packets on a connection\nfor the connection TTL time, then it will automatically close all the\nsessions on the server that relate to that connection.\nThe connection TTL is configured on the URI using the connectionTTL\nparameter.\nThe default value for connection ttl on an \"unreliable\" connection (e.g.\na Netty connection using the tcp URL scheme) is 60000ms, i.e. 1 minute.\nThe default value for connection ttl on a \"reliable\" connection (e.g. an\nin-vm connection using the vm URL scheme) is -1. A value of -1 for\nconnectionTTL means the server will never time out the connection on\nthe server side.\nIf you do not wish clients to be able to specify their own connection\nTTL, you can override all values used by a global value set on the\nserver side. This can be done by specifying the\nconnection-ttl-override attribute in the server side configuration.\nThe default value for connection-ttl-override is -1 which means \"do\nnot override\" (i.e. let clients use their own values).\nThe logic to check connections for TTL violations runs periodically on\nthe broker. By default, the checks are done every 2,000 milliseconds.\nHowever, this can be changed if necessary by using the \nconnection-ttl-check-interval attribute.\nClosing Forgotten Resources\nAs previously discussed, it's important that all core client sessions\nand JMS connections are always closed explicitly in a finally block\nwhen you are finished using them.\nIf you fail to do so, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis will detect this at garbage collection\ntime, and log a warning (If you are using JMS the warning will involve a JMS connection).\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis will then close the connection / client session for you.\nNote that the log will also tell you the exact line of your user code\nwhere you created the JMS connection / client session that you later did\nnot close. This will enable you to pinpoint the error in your code and\ncorrect it appropriately.\nDetecting Failure from the Client\nIn the previous section we discussed how the client sends pings to the\nserver and how \"dead\" connection resources are cleaned up by the server.\nThere's also another reason for pinging, and that's for the client to\nbe able to detect that the server or network has failed.\nAs long as the client is receiving data from the server it will consider\nthe connection to be still alive.\nIf the client does not receive any packets for a configurable number\nof milliseconds then it will consider the connection failed and will\neither initiate failover, or call any FailureListener instances (or\nExceptionListener instances if you are using JMS) depending on how \nit has been configured.\nThis is controlled by setting the clientFailureCheckPeriod parameter\non the URI your client is using to connect, e.g.\ntcp://localhost:61616?clientFailureCheckPeriod=30000.\nThe default value for client failure check period on an \"unreliable\"\nconnection (e.g. a Netty connection) is 30000 ms, i.e. 30 seconds. The\ndefault value for client failure check period on a \"reliable\" connection\n(e.g. an in-vm connection) is -1. A value of -1 means the client\nwill never fail the connection on the client side if no data is received\nfrom the server. Typically this is much lower than connection TTL to\nallow clients to reconnect in case of transitory failure.\nConfiguring Asynchronous Connection Execution\nMost packets received on the server side are executed on the remoting\nthread. These packets represent short-running operations and are always\nexecuted on the remoting thread for performance reasons.\nHowever, by default some kinds of packets are executed using a thread\nfrom a thread pool so that the remoting thread is not tied up for too\nlong. Please note that processing operations asynchronously on another\nthread adds a little more latency. These packets are:\n\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.core.protocol.core.impl.wireformat.RollbackMessage\n\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.core.protocol.core.impl.wireformat.SessionCloseMessage\n\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.core.protocol.core.impl.wireformat.SessionCommitMessage\n\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.core.protocol.core.impl.wireformat.SessionXACommitMessage\n\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.core.protocol.core.impl.wireformat.SessionXAPrepareMessage\n\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.core.protocol.core.impl.wireformat.SessionXARollbackMessage\n\n\nTo disable asynchronous connection execution, set the parameter\nasync-connection-execution-enabled in broker.xml to\nfalse (default value is true).\n"},"slow-consumers.html":{"url":"slow-consumers.html","title":"Detecting Slow Consumers","keywords":"","body":"Detecting Slow Consumers\nIn this section we will discuss how Apache ActiveMQ Artemis can be configured to deal\nwith slow consumers. A slow consumer with a server-side queue (e.g. JMS\ntopic subscriber) can pose a significant problem for broker performance.\nIf messages build up in the consumer's server-side queue then memory\nwill begin filling up and the broker may enter paging mode which would\nimpact performance negatively. However, criteria can be set so that\nconsumers which don't acknowledge messages quickly enough can\npotentially be disconnected from the broker which in the case of a\nnon-durable JMS subscriber would allow the broker to remove the\nsubscription and all of its messages freeing up valuable server\nresources.\nRequired Configuration\nBy default the server will not detect slow consumers. If slow consumer\ndetection is desired then see address model chapter\nfor more details on the required address settings.\nThe calculation to determine whether or not a consumer is slow only\ninspects the number of messages a particular consumer has\nacknowledged. It doesn't take into account whether or not flow control\nhas been enabled on the consumer, whether or not the consumer is\nstreaming a large message, etc. Keep this in mind when configuring slow\nconsumer detection.\nPlease note that slow consumer checks are performed using the scheduled\nthread pool and that each queue on the broker with slow consumer\ndetection enabled will cause a new entry in the internal\njava.util.concurrent.ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor instance. If there\nare a high number of queues and the slow-consumer-check-period is\nrelatively low then there may be delays in executing some of the checks.\nHowever, this will not impact the accuracy of the calculations used by\nthe detection algorithm. See thread pooling for more details about this pool.\nExample\nSee the slow consumer example which shows how to detect a slow consumer\nwith Apache ActiveMQ Artemis.\n"},"network-isolation.html":{"url":"network-isolation.html","title":"Avoiding Network Isolation","keywords":"","body":"Network Isolation (Split Brain)\nIt is possible that if a replicated live or backup server becomes isolated in a\nnetwork that failover will occur and you will end up with 2 live servers\nserving messages in a cluster, this we call split brain. There are different\nconfigurations you can choose from that will help mitigate this problem\nQuorum Voting\nQuorum voting is used by both the live and the backup to decide what to do if a\nreplication connection is disconnected.  Basically the server will request each\nlive server in the cluster to vote as to whether it thinks the server it is\nreplicating to or from is still alive. You can also configure the time for which\nthe quorum manager will wait for the quorum vote response. The default time is 30\nseconds you can configure like so for master and also for the slave:\n\n  \n    \n       12\n    \n  \n\n\nThis being the case the minimum number of live/backup pairs needed is 3. If less\nthan 3 pairs are used then the only option is to use a Network Pinger which is\nexplained later in this chapter or choose how you want each server to react which\nthe following details:\nBackup Voting\nBy default if a replica loses its replication connection to the live broker it\nmakes a decision as to whether to start or not with a quorum vote. This of\ncourse requires that there be at least 3 pairs of live/backup nodes in the\ncluster. For a 3 node cluster it will start if it gets 2 votes back saying that\nits live server is no longer available, for 4 nodes this would be 3 votes and\nso on. When a backup loses connection to the master it will keep voting for a\nquorum until it either receives a vote allowing it to start or it detects that\nthe master is still live. for the latter it will then restart as a backup. How\nmany votes and how long between each vote the backup should wait is configured\nlike so:\n\n  \n    \n       12\n       5000\n    \n  \n\n\nIt's also possible to statically set the quorum size that should be used for\nthe case where the cluster size is known up front, this is done on the Replica\nPolicy like so:\n\n  \n    \n       2\n    \n  \n\n\nIn this example the quorum size is set to 2 so if you were using a single pair\nand the backup lost connectivity it would never start.\nLive Voting\nBy default, if the live server loses its replication connection then it will\njust carry on and wait for a backup to reconnect and start replicating again.\nIn the event of a possible split brain scenario this may mean that the live\nstays live even though the backup has been activated. It is possible to\nconfigure the live server to vote for a quorum if this happens, in this way if\nthe live server doesn't not receive a majority vote then it will shutdown. This\nis done by setting the vote-on-replication-failure to true.\n\n  \n    \n       true\n       2\n    \n  \n\n\nAs in the backup policy it is also possible to statically configure the quorum\nsize.\nPinging the network\nYou may configure one more addresses on the broker.xml that are part of your\nnetwork topology, that will be pinged through the life cycle of the server.\nThe server will stop itself until the network is back on such case.\nIf you execute the create command passing a -ping argument, you will create a\ndefault xml that is ready to be used with network checks:\n./artemis create /myDir/myServer --ping 10.0.0.1\nThis XML part will be added to your broker.xml:\n element.\n theNicName\n-->\n\nhttp://www.apache.org -->\n\n10000\n1000\n\n\n10.0.0.1\n\n\nping -c 1 -t %d %s\n\n\nping6 -c 1 %2$s\n\nOnce you lose connectivity towards 10.0.0.1 on the given example, you will see\nsee this output at the server:\n09:49:24,562 WARN  [org.apache.activemq.artemis.core.server.NetworkHealthCheck] Ping Address /10.0.0.1 wasn't reacheable\n09:49:36,577 INFO  [org.apache.activemq.artemis.core.server.NetworkHealthCheck] Network is unhealthy, stopping service ActiveMQServerImpl::serverUUID=04fd5dd8-b18c-11e6-9efe-6a0001921ad0\n09:49:36,625 INFO  [org.apache.activemq.artemis.core.server] AMQ221002: Apache ActiveMQ Artemis Message Broker version 1.6.0 [04fd5dd8-b18c-11e6-9efe-6a0001921ad0] stopped, uptime 14.787 seconds\n09:50:00,653 WARN  [org.apache.activemq.artemis.core.server.NetworkHealthCheck] ping: sendto: No route to host\n09:50:10,656 WARN  [org.apache.activemq.artemis.core.server.NetworkHealthCheck] Host is down: java.net.ConnectException: Host is down\n    at java.net.Inet6AddressImpl.isReachable0(Native Method) [rt.jar:1.8.0_73]\n    at java.net.Inet6AddressImpl.isReachable(Inet6AddressImpl.java:77) [rt.jar:1.8.0_73]\n    at java.net.InetAddress.isReachable(InetAddress.java:502) [rt.jar:1.8.0_73]\n    at org.apache.activemq.artemis.core.server.NetworkHealthCheck.check(NetworkHealthCheck.java:295) [artemis-commons-1.6.0-SNAPSHOT.jar:1.6.0-SNAPSHOT]\n    at org.apache.activemq.artemis.core.server.NetworkHealthCheck.check(NetworkHealthCheck.java:276) [artemis-commons-1.6.0-SNAPSHOT.jar:1.6.0-SNAPSHOT]\n    at org.apache.activemq.artemis.core.server.NetworkHealthCheck.run(NetworkHealthCheck.java:244) [artemis-commons-1.6.0-SNAPSHOT.jar:1.6.0-SNAPSHOT]\n    at org.apache.activemq.artemis.core.server.ActiveMQScheduledComponent$2.run(ActiveMQScheduledComponent.java:189) [artemis-commons-1.6.0-SNAPSHOT.jar:1.6.0-SNAPSHOT]\n    at org.apache.activemq.artemis.core.server.ActiveMQScheduledComponent$3.run(ActiveMQScheduledComponent.java:199) [artemis-commons-1.6.0-SNAPSHOT.jar:1.6.0-SNAPSHOT]\n    at java.util.concurrent.Executors$RunnableAdapter.call(Executors.java:511) [rt.jar:1.8.0_73]\n    at java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.runAndReset(FutureTask.java:308) [rt.jar:1.8.0_73]\n    at java.util.concurrent.ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor$ScheduledFutureTask.access$301(ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor.java:180) [rt.jar:1.8.0_73]\n    at java.util.concurrent.ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor$ScheduledFutureTask.run(ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor.java:294) [rt.jar:1.8.0_73]\n    at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1142) [rt.jar:1.8.0_73]\n    at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:617) [rt.jar:1.8.0_73]\n    at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:745) [rt.jar:1.8.0_73]\nOnce you re establish your network connections towards the configured check list:\n09:53:23,461 INFO  [org.apache.activemq.artemis.core.server.NetworkHealthCheck] Network is healthy, starting service ActiveMQServerImpl::\n09:53:23,462 INFO  [org.apache.activemq.artemis.core.server] AMQ221000: live Message Broker is starting with configuration Broker Configuration (clustered=false,journalDirectory=./data/journal,bindingsDirectory=./data/bindings,largeMessagesDirectory=./data/large-messages,pagingDirectory=./data/paging)\n09:53:23,462 INFO  [org.apache.activemq.artemis.core.server] AMQ221013: Using NIO Journal\n09:53:23,462 INFO  [org.apache.activemq.artemis.core.server] AMQ221043: Protocol module found: [artemis-server].

For performance reasons clients normally\nbuffer messages before delivering to the consumer via the receive()\nmethod or asynchronously via a message listener. If the consumer cannot\nprocess messages as fast as they are being delivered and stored in the\ninternal buffer, then you could end up with a situation where messages\nwould keep building up possibly causing out of memory on the client if\nthey cannot be processed in time.\nWindow-Based Flow Control\nBy default, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis consumers buffer messages from the server in a\nclient side buffer before the client consumes them. This improves\nperformance: otherwise every time the client consumes a message,\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis would have to go the server to request the next message. In\nturn, this message would then get sent to the client side, if one was\navailable.\nA network round trip would be involved for every message and\nconsiderably reduce performance.\nTo prevent this, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis pre-fetches messages into a buffer on each\nconsumer. The total maximum size of messages (in bytes) that will be\nbuffered on each consumer is determined by the consumerWindowSize\nparameter.\nBy default, the consumerWindowSize is set to 1 MiB (1024 * 1024\nbytes) unless overridden via (Address Settings)\nThe value can be:\n\n-1 for an unbounded buffer\n\n0 to not buffer any messages.\n\n>0 for a buffer with the given maximum size in bytes.\n\n\nSetting the consumer window size can considerably improve performance\ndepending on the messaging use case. As an example, let's consider the\ntwo extremes:\nFast consumers\nFast consumers can process messages as fast as they consume them (or\neven faster)\nTo allow fast consumers, set the consumerWindowSize to -1. This\nwill allow unbounded message buffering on the client side.\nUse this setting with caution: it can overflow the client memory if\nthe consumer is not able to process messages as fast as it receives\nthem.\nSlow consumers\nSlow consumers takes significant time to process each message and it\nis desirable to prevent buffering messages on the client side so\nthat they can be delivered to another consumer instead.\nConsider a situation where a queue has 2 consumers; 1 of which is\nvery slow. Messages are delivered in a round robin fashion to both\nconsumers, the fast consumer processes all of its messages very\nquickly until its buffer is empty. At this point there are still\nmessages awaiting to be processed in the buffer of the slow consumer\nthus preventing them being processed by the fast consumer. The fast\nconsumer is therefore sitting idle when it could be processing the\nother messages.\nTo allow slow consumers, set consumerWindowSize on the URI to 0\n(for no buffer at all). This will prevent the slow consumer from\nbuffering any messages on the client side. Messages will remain on\nthe server side ready to be consumed by other consumers.\nSetting this to 0 can give deterministic distribution between\nmultiple consumers on a queue.\nMost of the consumers cannot be clearly identified as fast or slow\nconsumers but are in-between. In that case, setting the value of\nconsumerWindowSize to optimize performance depends on the messaging\nuse case and requires benchmarks to find the optimal value, but a value\nof 1MiB is fine in most cases.\nPlease see the examples chapter for an example which shows\nhow to configure ActiveMQ Artemis to prevent consumer buffering when dealing\nwith slow consumers.\nRate limited flow control\nIt is also possible to control the rate at which a consumer can\nconsume messages. This is a form of throttling and can be used to make\nsure that a consumer never consumes messages at a rate faster than the\nrate specified. This is configured using the consumerMaxRate URI\nparameter.\nThe rate must be a positive integer to enable this functionality and is\nthe maximum desired message consumption rate specified in units of\nmessages per second. Setting this to -1 disables rate limited flow\ncontrol. The default value is -1.\nPlease see the examples chapter for a working example of\nlimiting consumer rate.\n\nNote:\nRate limited flow control can be used in conjunction with window based\nflow control. Rate limited flow control only effects how many messages\na client can consume in a second and not how many messages are in its\nbuffer. So if you had a slow rate limit and a high window based limit\nthe clients internal buffer would soon fill up with messages.\n\nProducer flow control\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis also can limit the amount of data sent from a client to a\nserver to prevent the server being overwhelmed.\nWindow based flow control\nIn a similar way to consumer window based flow control, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis\nproducers, by default, can only send messages to an address as long as\nthey have sufficient credits to do so. The amount of credits required to\nsend a message is given by the size of the message.\nAs producers run low on credits they request more from the server, when\nthe server sends them more credits they can send more messages.\nThe amount of credits a producer requests in one go is known as the\nwindow size and it is controlled by the producerWindowSize URI\nparameter.\nThe window size therefore determines the amount of bytes that can be\nin-flight at any one time before more need to be requested - this\nprevents the remoting connection from getting overloaded.\nBlocking CORE Producers\nWhen using the CORE protocol (used by both the Artemis Core Client and Artemis JMS Client)\nthe server will always aim give the same number of credits as have been requested.\nHowever, it is also possible to set a maximum size on any address, and the server\nwill never send more credits to any one producer than what is available according to\nthe address's upper memory limit.  Although a single producer will be issued more\ncredits than available (at the time of issue) it is possible that more than 1\nproducer be associated with the same address and so it is theoretically possible\nthat more credits are allocated across total producers than what is available.\nIt is therefore possible to go over the address limit by approximately:\ntotal number of producers on address * producer window size\nFor example, if I have a queue called \"myqueue\", I could set the\nmaximum memory size to 10MiB, and the the server will control the number\nof credits sent to any producers which are sending any messages to\nmyqueue such that the total messages in the queue never exceeds 10MiB.\nWhen the address gets full, producers will block on the client side\nuntil more space frees up on the address, i.e. until messages are\nconsumed from the queue thus freeing up space for more messages to be\nsent.\nWe call this blocking producer flow control, and it's an efficient way\nto prevent the server running out of memory due to producers sending\nmore messages than can be handled at any time.\nIt is an alternative approach to paging, which does not block producers\nbut instead pages messages to storage.\nTo configure an address with a maximum size and tell the server that you\nwant to block producers for this address if it becomes full, you need to\ndefine an AddressSettings (Configuring Queues Via Address Settings) block for the address and specify\nmax-size-bytes and address-full-policy\nThe address block applies to all queues registered to that address. I.e.\nthe total memory for all queues bound to that address will not exceed\nmax-size-bytes. In the case of JMS topics this means the total\nmemory of all subscriptions in the topic won't exceed max-size-bytes.\nHere's an example:\n\n   \n      100000\n      BLOCK\n   \n\n\nThe above example would set the max size of the queue \"exampleQueue\"\nto be 100000 bytes and would block any producers sending to that address\nto prevent that max size being exceeded.\nNote the policy must be set to BLOCK to enable blocking producer flow\ncontrol.\n\nNote:\nNote that in the default configuration all addresses are set to block\nproducers after 10 MiB of message data is in the address. This means\nyou cannot send more than 10MiB of message data to an address without\nit being consumed before the producers will be blocked. If you do not\nwant this behaviour increase the max-size-bytes parameter or change\nthe address full message policy.\nNote:\nProducer credits are allocated from the broker to the client.  Flow control\ncredit checking (i.e. checking a producer has enough credit) is done on the\nclient side only.  It is possible for the broker to over allocate credits, like\nin the multiple producer scenario outlined above.  It is also possible for\na misbehaving client to ignore the flow control credits issued by the broker\nand continue sending with out sufficient credit.\n\nBlocking AMQP Producers\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis ships with out of the box with 2 protocols that support flow control. Artemis CORE protocol and\nAMQP. Both protocols implement flow control slightly differently and therefore address full BLOCK policy behaves slightly\ndifferent for clients that use each protocol respectively.\nAs explained earlier in this chapter the CORE protocol uses a producer window size flow control system. Where credits\n(representing bytes) are allocated to producers, if a producer wants to send a message it should wait until it has\nenough byte credits available for it to send. AMQP flow control credits are not representative of bytes but instead\nrepresent the number of messages a producer is permitted to send (regardless of the message size).\nBLOCK for AMQP works mostly in the same way as the producer window size mechanism above. Artemis will issue 100 credits\nto a client at a time and refresh them when the clients credits reaches 30. The broker will stop issuing credits once an\naddress is full. However, since AMQP credits represent whole messages and not bytes, it would be possible in some\nscenarios for an AMQP client to significantly exceed an address upper bound should the broker continue accepting\nmessages until the clients credits are exhausted. For this reason there is an additional parameter available on address\nsettings that specifies an upper bound on an address size in bytes. Once this upper bound is reach Artemis will start\nrejecting AMQP messages. This limit is the max-size-bytes-reject-threshold and is by default set to -1 (or no limit).\nThis is additional parameter allows a kind of soft and hard limit, in normal circumstances the broker will utilize the\nmax-size-bytes parameter using using flow control to put back pressure on the client, but will protect the broker by\nrejecting messages once the address size is reached.\nRate limited flow control\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis also allows the rate a producer can emit message to be limited,\nin units of messages per second. By specifying such a rate, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis\nwill ensure that producer never produces messages at a rate higher than\nthat specified. This is controlled by the producerMaxRate URL parameter.\nThe producerMaxRate must be a positive integer to enable this functionality and is\nthe maximum desired message production rate specified in units of\nmessages per second. Setting this to -1 disables rate limited flow\ncontrol. The default value is -1.\nPlease see the examples chapter for a working example of limiting \nproducer rate.\n"},"send-guarantees.html":{"url":"send-guarantees.html","title":"Guarantees of sends and commits","keywords":"","body":"Guarantees of Sends and Commits\nTransaction Completion\nWhen committing or rolling back a transaction with Apache ActiveMQ Artemis, the request\nto commit or rollback is sent to the server, and the call will block on\nthe client side until a response has been received from the server that\nthe commit or rollback was executed.\nWhen the commit or rollback is received on the server, it will be\ncommitted to the journal, and depending on the value of the parameter\njournal-sync-transactional the server will ensure that the commit or\nrollback is durably persisted to storage before sending the response\nback to the client. If this parameter has the value false then commit\nor rollback may not actually get persisted to storage until some time\nafter the response has been sent to the client. In event of server\nfailure this may mean the commit or rollback never gets persisted to\nstorage. The default value of this parameter is true so the client can\nbe sure all transaction commits or rollbacks have been persisted to\nstorage by the time the call to commit or rollback returns.\nSetting this parameter to false can improve performance at the expense\nof some loss of transaction durability.\nThis parameter is set in broker.xml\nNon Transactional Message Sends\nIf you are sending messages to a server using a non transacted session,\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis can be configured to block the call to send until the message\nhas definitely reached the server, and a response has been sent back to\nthe client. This can be configured individually for durable and\nnon-durable messages, and is determined by the following two URL parameters:\n\nblockOnDurableSend. If this is set to true then all calls to\nsend for durable messages on non transacted sessions will block\nuntil the message has reached the server, and a response has been\nsent back. The default value is true.\n\nblockOnNonDurableSend. If this is set to true then all calls to\nsend for non-durable messages on non transacted sessions will block\nuntil the message has reached the server, and a response has been\nsent back. The default value is false.\n\n\nSetting block on sends to true can reduce performance since each send\nrequires a network round trip before the next send can be performed.\nThis means the performance of sending messages will be limited by the\nnetwork round trip time (RTT) of your network, rather than the bandwidth\nof your network. For better performance we recommend either batching\nmany messages sends together in a transaction since with a transactional\nsession, only the commit / rollback blocks not every send, or, using\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis's advanced asynchronous send acknowledgements feature\ndescribed in Asynchronous Send Acknowledgements.\nWhen the server receives a message sent from a non transactional\nsession, and that message is durable and the message is routed to at\nleast one durable queue, then the server will persist the message in\npermanent storage. If the journal parameter\njournal-sync-non-transactional is set to true the server will not\nsend a response back to the client until the message has been persisted\nand the server has a guarantee that the data has been persisted to disk.\nThe default value for this parameter is true.\nNon Transactional Acknowledgements\nIf you are acknowledging the delivery of a message at the client side\nusing a non transacted session, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis can be configured to block the\ncall to acknowledge until the acknowledge has definitely reached the\nserver, and a response has been sent back to the client. This is\nconfigured with the parameter BlockOnAcknowledge. If this is set to\ntrue then all calls to acknowledge on non transacted sessions will\nblock until the acknowledge has reached the server, and a response has\nbeen sent back. You might want to set this to true if you want to\nimplement a strict at most once delivery policy. The default value is\nfalse\nAsynchronous Send Acknowledgements\nIf you are using a non transacted session but want a guarantee that\nevery message sent to the server has reached it, then, as discussed in\nGuarantees of Non Transactional Message Sends, you can configure Apache ActiveMQ Artemis to block the call to send until the server\nhas received the message, persisted it and sent back a response. This\nworks well but has a severe performance penalty - each call to send\nneeds to block for at least the time of a network round trip (RTT) - the\nperformance of sending is thus limited by the latency of the network,\nnot limited by the network bandwidth.\nLet's do a little bit of maths to see how severe that is. We'll consider\na standard 1Gib ethernet network with a network round trip between the\nserver and the client of 0.25 ms.\nWith a RTT of 0.25 ms, the client can send at most 1000/ 0.25 = 4000\nmessages per second if it blocks on each message send.\nIf each message is theoretical upper limit\nof (1024 * 1024 * 1024 / 8) / 1500 = 89478 messages per second if\nmessages are sent without blocking! These figures aren't an exact\nscience but you can clearly see that being limited by network RTT can\nhave serious effect on performance.\nTo remedy this, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis provides an advanced new feature called\nasynchronous send acknowledgements. With this feature, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis can be\nconfigured to send messages without blocking in one direction and\nasynchronously getting acknowledgement from the server that the messages\nwere received in a separate stream. By de-coupling the send from the\nacknowledgement of the send, the system is not limited by the network\nRTT, but is limited by the network bandwidth. Consequently better\nthroughput can be achieved than is possible using a blocking approach,\nwhile at the same time having absolute guarantees that messages have\nsuccessfully reached the server.\nThe window size for send acknowledgements is determined by the\nconfirmation-window-size parameter on the connection factory or client\nsession factory. Please see Client Reconnection and Session Reattachment for more info on this.\nTo use the feature using the core API, you implement the interface\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.api.core.client.SendAcknowledgementHandler and set\na handler instance on your ClientSession.\nThen, you just send messages as normal using your ClientSession, and\nas messages reach the server, the server will send back an\nacknowledgement of the send asynchronously, and some time later you are\ninformed at the client side by Apache ActiveMQ Artemis calling your handler's\nsendAcknowledged(ClientMessage message) method, passing in a reference\nto the message that was sent.\nTo enable asynchronous send acknowledgements you must make sure\nconfirmationWindowSize is set to a positive integer value, e.g.\n10MiB\nPlease see the examples chapter for a full working example.\n"},"undelivered-messages.html":{"url":"undelivered-messages.html","title":"Message Redelivery and Undelivered Messages","keywords":"","body":"Message Redelivery and Undelivered Messages\nMessages can be delivered unsuccessfully (e.g. if the transacted session\nused to consume them is rolled back). Such a message goes back to its\nqueue ready to be redelivered. However, this means it is possible for a\nmessage to be delivered again and again without success thus remaining\nin the queue indefinitely, clogging the system.\nThere are 2 ways to deal with these undelivered messages:\n\nDelayed redelivery.\nIt is possible to delay messages redelivery.  This gives the client some\ntime to recover from any transient failures and to prevent overloading\nits network or CPU resources.\n\nDead Letter Address.\nIt is also possible to configure a dead letter address so that after\na specified number of unsuccessful deliveries, messages are removed\nfrom their queue and sent to the dead letter address.  These messages\nwill not be delivered again from this queue.\n\n\nBoth options can be combined for maximum flexibility.\nDelayed Redelivery\nDelaying redelivery can often be useful in cases where clients regularly\nfail or rollback. Without a delayed redelivery, the system can get into a\n\"thrashing\" state, with delivery being attempted, the client rolling back,\nand delivery being re-attempted ad infinitum in quick succession,\nconsuming valuable CPU and network resources.\nConfiguring Delayed Redelivery\nDelayed redelivery is defined in the address-setting configuration:\n\n\n   \n   1.5\n   \n   5000\n   \n   0.15\n   \n   50000\n\n\nIf a redelivery-delay is specified, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis will wait this delay\nbefore redelivering the messages.\nBy default, there is no redelivery delay (redelivery-delayis set to\n0).\nOther subsequent messages will be delivery regularly, only the cancelled\nmessage will be sent asynchronously back to the queue after the delay.\nYou can specify a multiplier (the redelivery-delay-multiplier) that will\ntake effect on top of the redelivery-delay.  Each time a message is redelivered\nthe delay period will be equal to the previous delay  redelivery-delay-multiplier.\nA max-redelivery-delay can be set to prevent the delay from becoming too large.\nThe max-redelivery-delay is defaulted to redelivery-delay \\ 10.\nExample:\n\nredelivery-delay=5000, redelivery-delay-multiplier=2, max-redelivery-delay=15000,\nredelivery-collision-avoidance-factor=0.0\n\nDelivery Attempt 1. (Unsuccessful)\n\nWait Delay Period: 5000\nDelivery Attempt 2. (Unsuccessful)\nWait Delay Period: 10000                   // (5000  * 2) \nDelivery Attempt 3: (Unsuccessful)\nWait Delay Period: 15000                   // (10000 * 2) > max-delay-period:  Use max-delay-delivery\n\nAddress wildcards can be used to configure redelivery delay for a set of\naddresses (see Understanding the Wildcard Syntax), so you don't have to specify redelivery delay\nindividually for each address.\nThe redelivery-delay can be also be modified by configuring the\nredelivery-collision-avoidance-factor. This factor will be made either\npositive or negative at random to control whether the ultimate value will\nincrease or decrease the redelivery-delay. Then it's multiplied by a random\nnumber between 0.0 and 1.0. This result is then multiplied by the\nredelivery-delay and then added to the redelivery-delay to arrive at the\nfinal value.\nThe algorithm may sound complicated but the bottom line is quite simple: the\nlarger redelivery-collision-avoidance-factor you choose the larger the variance\nof the redelivery-delay will be. The redelivery-collision-avoidance-factor\nmust be between 0.0 and 1.0.\nExample:\n\nredelivery-delay=1000, redelivery-delay-multiplier=1, max-redelivery-delay=15000,\nredelivery-collision-avoidance-factor=0.5, (bold values chosen using\njava.util.Random)\n\nDelivery Attempt 1. (Unsuccessful)\n\nWait Delay Period: 875                     // 1000 + (1000  ((0.5 \\ -1) * .25)\nDelivery Attempt 2. (Unsuccessful)\nWait Delay Period: 1375                    // 1000 + (1000  ((0.5 \\ 1) * .75)\nDelivery Attempt 3: (Unsuccessful)\nWait Delay Period: 975                     // 1000 + (1000  ((0.5 \\ -1) * .05)\n\nThis feature can be particularly useful in environments where there are\nmultiple consumers on the same queue all interacting transactionally\nwith the same external system (e.g. a database). If there is overlapping\ndata in messages which are consumed concurrently then one transaction can\nsucceed while all the rest fail. If those failed messages are redelivered\nat the same time then this process where one consumer succeeds and the\nrest fail will continue. By randomly padding the redelivery-delay by a\nsmall, configurable amount these redelivery \"collisions\" can be avoided.\nExample\nSee the examples chapter for an example which shows how\ndelayed redelivery is configured and used with JMS.\nDead Letter Addresses\nTo prevent a client infinitely receiving the same undelivered message\n(regardless of what is causing the unsuccessful deliveries), messaging\nsystems define dead letter addresses: after a specified unsuccessful\ndelivery attempts, the message is removed from its queue and sent\nto a dead letter address.\nAny such messages can then be diverted to queue(s) where they can later\nbe perused by the system administrator for action to be taken.\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis's addresses can be assigned a dead letter address. Once the\nmessages have been unsuccessfully delivered for a given number of\nattempts, they are removed from their queue and sent to the relevant\ndead letter address. These dead letter messages can later be consumed\nfrom the dead letter address for further inspection.\nConfiguring Dead Letter Addresses\nDead letter address is defined in the address-setting configuration:\n\n\n   deadLetterAddress\n   3\n\n\nIf a dead-letter-address is not specified, messages will removed after\nmax-delivery-attempts unsuccessful attempts.\nBy default, messages are redelivered 10 times at the maximum. Set\nmax-delivery-attempts to -1 for infinite redeliveries.\nA dead letter address can be set globally for a set of matching\naddresses and you can set max-delivery-attempts to -1 for a specific\naddress setting to allow infinite redeliveries only for this address.\nAddress wildcards can be used to configure dead letter settings for a\nset of addresses (see Understanding the Wildcard Syntax).\nDead Letter Properties\nDead letter messages get special properties.\nAutomatically Creating Dead Letter Resources\nIt's common to segregate undelivered messages by their original address.\nFor example, a message sent to the stocks address that couldn't be\ndelivered for some reason might be ultimately routed to the DLQ.stocks\nqueue, and likewise a message sent to the orders address that couldn't\nbe delivered might be routed to the DLQ.orders queue.\nUsing this pattern can make it easy to track and administrate\nundelivered messages. However, it can pose a challenge in environments\nwhich predominantly use auto-created addresses and queues. Typically\nadministrators in those environments don't want to manually create\nan address-setting to configure the dead-letter-address much less\nthe actual address and queue to hold the undelivered messages.\nThe solution to this problem is to set the auto-create-dead-letter-resources\naddress-setting to true (it's false by default) so that the broker will\ncreate the address and queue to deal with the undelivered messages\nautomatically. The address created will be the one defined by the\ndead-letter-address. A MULTICAST queue will be created on that address.\nIt will be named by the address to which the message was previously sent, and\nit will have a filter defined using the property _AMQ_ORIG_ADDRESS so that it\n will only receive messages sent to the relevant address. The queue name\n can be configured with a prefix and suffix. See the relevant settings in the\n table below:\n\n\n\naddress-setting\ndefault\n\n\n\n\ndead-letter-queue-prefix\nDLQ.\n\n\ndead-letter-queue-suffix\n(empty string)\n\n\n\nHere is an example configuration:\n\n   DLA\n   3\n   true\n    \n   .DLQ\n\n\nThe queue holding the undeliverable messages can be accessed directly\neither by using the queue's name by itself (e.g. when using the core\nclient) or by using the fully qualified queue name (e.g. when using\na JMS client) just like any other queue. Also, note that the queue is\nauto-created which means it will be auto-deleted as per the relevant\naddress-settings.\nExample\nSee: Dead Letter section of the Examples for an example\nthat shows how dead letter resources can be statically configured and\nused with JMS.\nDelivery Count Persistence\nIn normal use, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis does not update delivery count persistently\nuntil a message is rolled back (i.e. the delivery count is not updated\nbefore the message is delivered to the consumer). In most messaging\nuse cases, the messages are consumed, acknowledged and forgotten as soon\nas they are consumed. In these cases, updating the delivery count\npersistently before delivering the message would add an extra persistent\nstep for each message delivered, implying a significant performance\npenalty.\nHowever, if the delivery count is not updated persistently before the\nmessage delivery happens, in the event of a server crash, messages might\nhave been delivered but that will not have been reflected in the\ndelivery count. During the recovery phase, the server will not have\nknowledge of that and will deliver the message with redelivered set to\nfalse while it should be true.\nAs this behavior breaks strict JMS semantics, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis allows to persist\ndelivery count before message delivery but this feature is disabled by default\ndue to performance implications.\nTo enable it, set persist-delivery-count-before-delivery to true in\nbroker.xml:\ntrue\n\n"},"message-expiry.html":{"url":"message-expiry.html","title":"Message Expiry","keywords":"","body":"Message Expiry\nMessages can be set with an optional time to live when sending them.\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis will not deliver a message to a consumer after it's\ntime to live has been exceeded.

For JDBC persistence the large-message-table should be\nconfigured.\n\n   \n      ...\n      /data/large-messages\n      ...\n   \n\n\nBy default the large message directory is data/largemessages and\nlarge-message-table is configured as \"LARGE_MESSAGE_TABLE\".\nFor the best performance we recommend using file store with large messages\ndirectory stored on a different physical volume to the message journal or\npaging directory.\nConfiguring the Core Client\nAny message larger than a certain size is considered a large message.  Large\nmessages will be split up and sent in fragments. This is determined by the URL\nparameter minLargeMessageSize\n\nNote:\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis messages are encoded using 2 bytes per character so\nif the message data is filled with ASCII characters (which are 1 byte) the\nsize of the resulting Apache ActiveMQ Artemis message would roughly double.\nThis is important when calculating the size of a \"large\" message as it may\nappear to be less than the minLargeMessageSize before it is sent, but it\nthen turns into a \"large\" message once it is encoded.\n\nThe default value is 100KiB.\nConfiguring the transport directly from the client\nside\nwill provide more information on how to instantiate the core session factory or\nJMS connection factory.\nCompressed Large Messages on Core Protocol\nYou can choose to send large messages in compressed form using\ncompressLargeMessages URL parameter.\nIf you specify the boolean URL parameter compressLargeMessages as true, The\nsystem will use the ZIP algorithm to compress the message body as the message\nis transferred to the server's side. Notice that there's no special treatment\nat the server's side, all the compressing and uncompressing is done at the\nclient.\nIf the compressed size of a large message is below minLargeMessageSize, it is\nsent to server as regular messages. This means that the message won't be\nwritten into the server's large-message data directory, thus reducing the disk\nI/O.\nStreaming large messages from Core Protocol\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis supports setting the body of messages using input and\noutput streams (java.lang.io)\nThese streams are then used directly for sending (input streams) and receiving\n(output streams) messages.\nWhen receiving messages there are 2 ways to deal with the output stream; you\nmay choose to block while the output stream is recovered using the method\nClientMessage.saveOutputStream or alternatively using the method\nClientMessage.setOutputstream which will asynchronously write the message to\nthe stream. If you choose the latter the consumer must be kept alive until the\nmessage has been fully received.\nYou can use any kind of stream you like. The most common use case is to send\nfiles stored in your disk, but you could also send things like JDBC Blobs,\nSocketInputStream, things you recovered from HTTPRequests etc. Anything as\nlong as it implements java.io.InputStream for sending messages or\njava.io.OutputStream for receiving them.\nStreaming over Core API\nThe following table shows a list of methods available at ClientMessage which\nare also available through JMS by the use of object properties.\n\n\n\nName\nDescription\nJMS Equivalent\n\n\n\n\nsetBodyInputStream(InputStream)\nSet the InputStream used to read a message body when sending it.\nJMS_AMQ_InputStream\n\n\nsetOutputStream(OutputStream)\nSet the OutputStream that will receive the body of a message.

You can\nuse the method Message.setObjectProperty to set the input and output streams.\nThe InputStream can be defined through the JMS Object Property\nJMS_AMQ_InputStream on messages being sent:\nBytesMessage message = session.createBytesMessage();\n\nFileInputStream fileInputStream = new FileInputStream(fileInput);\n\nBufferedInputStream bufferedInput = new BufferedInputStream(fileInputStream);\n\nmessage.setObjectProperty(\"JMS_AMQ_InputStream\", bufferedInput);\n\nsomeProducer.send(message);\n\nThe OutputStream can be set through the JMS Object Property\nJMS_AMQ_SaveStream on messages being received in a blocking way.\nBytesMessage messageReceived = (BytesMessage)messageConsumer.receive(120000);\n\nFile outputFile = new File(\"huge_message_received.dat\");\n\nFileOutputStream fileOutputStream = new FileOutputStream(outputFile);\n\nBufferedOutputStream bufferedOutput = new BufferedOutputStream(fileOutputStream);\n\n// This will block until the entire content is saved on disk\nmessageReceived.setObjectProperty(\"JMS_AMQ_SaveStream\", bufferedOutput);\n\nSetting the OutputStream could also be done in a non blocking way\nusing the property JMS_AMQ_OutputStream.\n// This won't wait the stream to finish.

If you set max-size-bytes = -1 on paging the\nglobal-max-size can still be used.\nWhen you have more messages than what is configured global-max-size any new\nproduced message will make that destination to go through its paging policy. \nglobal-max-size is calculated as half of the max memory available to the Java\nVirtual Machine, unless specified on the broker.xml configuration.\nDropping messages\nInstead of paging messages when the max size is reached, an address can also be\nconfigured to just drop messages when the address is full.\nTo do this just set the address-full-policy to DROP in the address settings\nDropping messages and throwing an exception to producers\nInstead of paging messages when the max size is reached, an address can also be\nconfigured to drop messages and also throw an exception on the client-side when\nthe address is full.\nTo do this just set the address-full-policy to FAIL in the address settings\nBlocking producers\nInstead of paging messages when the max size is reached, an address can also be\nconfigured to block producers from sending further messages when the address is\nfull, thus preventing the memory being exhausted on the server.\nWhen memory is freed up on the server, producers will automatically unblock and\nbe able to continue sending.\nTo do this just set the address-full-policy to BLOCK in the address\nsettings\nIn the default configuration, all addresses are configured to block producers\nafter 10 MiB of data are in the address.\nCaution with Addresses with Multiple Multicast Queues\nWhen a message is routed to an address that has multiple multicast queues bound\nto it, e.g. a JMS subscription in a Topic, there is only 1 copy of the message\nin memory. Each queue only deals with a reference to this.  Because of this the\nmemory is only freed up once all queues referencing the message have delivered\nit.\nIf you have a single lazy subscription, the entire address will suffer IO\nperformance hit as all the queues will have messages being sent through an\nextra storage on the paging system.\nFor example:\n\nAn address has 10 multicast queues\n\nOne of the queues does not deliver its messages (maybe because of a\nslow consumer).\n\nMessages continually arrive at the address and paging is started.\n\nThe other 9 queues are empty even though messages have been sent.\n\n\nIn this example all the other 9 queues will be consuming messages from the page\nsystem. This may cause performance issues if this is an undesirable state.\nMax Disk Usage\nThe System will perform scans on the disk to determine if the disk is beyond a\nconfigured limit.  These are configured through max-disk-usage in percentage.\nOnce that limit is reached any message will be blocked. (unless the protocol\ndoesn't support flow control on which case there will be an exception thrown\nand the connection for those clients dropped).\nPage Sync Timeout\nThe pages are synced periodically and the sync period is configured through\npage-sync-timeout in nanoseconds. When using NIO journal, by default has\nthe same value of journal-buffer-timeout. When using ASYNCIO, the default\nshould be 3333333.\nExample\nSee the Paging Example which shows how to use paging with \nApache ActiveMQ Artemis.\n"},"scheduled-messages.html":{"url":"scheduled-messages.html","title":"Scheduled Messages","keywords":"","body":"Scheduled Messages\nScheduled messages differ from normal messages in that they won't be\ndelivered until a specified time in the future, at the earliest.\nTo do this, a special property is set on the message before sending it.\nScheduled Delivery Property\nThe property name used to identify a scheduled message is\n\"_AMQ_SCHED_DELIVERY\" (or the constant\nMessage.HDR_SCHEDULED_DELIVERY_TIME).\nThe specified value must be a positive long corresponding to the time\nthe message must be delivered (in milliseconds).

Such a browser is an instance of a \"non-destructive\" consumer.\nIf every consumer on a queue is non destructive then we can obtain some interesting behaviours. In the case of a LVQ then the queue will always contain the most up to date value for every key. \nA queue can be created to enforce all consumers are non-destructive for last value queue. This can be be achieved using the following queue configuration:\n\n   \n      \n   \n\n\nOr on auto-create when using the JMS Client by using address parameters when \ncreating the destination used by the consumer.\nQueue queue = session.createQueue(\"my.destination.name?last-value-key=reuters_code&non-destructive=true\");\nTopic topic = session.createTopic(\"my.destination.name?last-value-key=reuters_code&non-destructive=true\");\n\nAlso the default for all queues under and address can be defaulted using the \naddress-setting configuration:\n\n   reuters_code\n   true\n\n\nBy default, default-non-destructive is false.\nBounding size using expiry-delay\nFor queues other than LVQs, having only non-destructive consumers could mean that messages would never get deleted, leaving the queue to grow unconstrainedly. To prevent this you can use the ability to set a default expiry-delay.\nSee expiry-delay for more details on this.\nExample\nSee the last-value queue example which shows \nhow last value queues are configured and used with JMS.\n"},"ring-queues.html":{"url":"ring-queues.html","title":"Ring Queues","keywords":"","body":"Ring Queue\nQueues operate with first-in, first-out (FIFO) semantics which means that\nmessages, in general, are added to the \"tail\" of the queue and removed from the\n\"head.\" A \"ring\" queue is a special type of queue with a fixed size. The\nfixed size is maintained by removing the message at the head of the queue when\nthe number of messages on the queue reaches the configured size.\nFor example, consider a queue configured with a ring size of 3 and a producer\nwhich sends the messages A, B, C, & D in that order. Once C is sent\nthe number of messages in the queue will be 3 which is the same as the\nconfigured ring size.

However, there are a few other important use cases\ninvolving:\n\nMessages in delivery & rollbacks\nScheduled messages\nPaging\n\nHowever, before we get to those use cases let's look at the basic configuration\nof a ring queue.\nConfiguration\nThere are 2 parameters related to ring queue configuration.\nThe ring-size parameter can be set directly on the queue element. The\ndefault value comes from the default-ring-size address-setting (see below).\n\n   \n      \n         \n      \n   \n\n\nThe default-ring-size is an address-setting which applies to queues on\nmatching addresses which don't have an explicit ring-size set. This is\nespecially useful for auto-created queues. The default value is -1 (i.e.\nno limit).\n\n   \n      3\n   \n\n\nThe ring-size may be updated at runtime. If the new ring-size is set\nlower than the previous ring-size the broker will not immediately delete\nenough messages from the head of the queue to enforce the new size. New\nmessages sent to the queue will force the deletion of old messages (i.e. the\nqueue won't grow any larger), but the queue will not reach its new size until\nit does so naturally through the normal consumption of messages by\nclients.\nMessages in Delivery & Rollbacks\nWhen messages are \"in delivery\" they are in an in-between state where they are\nnot technically on the queue but they are also not yet acknowledged. The\nbroker is at the consumer’s mercy to either acknowledge such messages or not.\nIn the context of a ring queue, messages which are in-delivery cannot be\nremoved from the queue.\nThis presents a few dilemmas.\nDue to the nature of messages in delivery a client can actually send more\nmessages to a ring queue than it would otherwise permit. This can make it\nappear that the ring-size is not being enforced properly. Consider this\nsimple scenario:\n\nQueue foo with ring-size=\"3\"\n1 Consumer on queue foo\nMessage A sent to foo & dispatched to consumer\nmessageCount=1, deliveringCount=1\nMessage B sent to foo & dispatched to consumer\nmessageCount=2, deliveringCount=2\nMessage C sent to foo & dispatched to consumer\nmessageCount=3, deliveringCount=3\nMessage D sent to foo & dispatched to consumer\nmessageCount=4, deliveringCount=4\n\nThe messageCount for foo is now 4, one greater than the ring-size\nof 3! However, the broker has no choice but to allow this because it cannot\nremove messages from the queue which are in delivery.\nNow consider that the consumer is closed without actually acknowledging any\nof these 4 messages. These 4 in-delivery, unacknowledged messages will be\ncancelled back to the broker and added to the head of the queue in the\nreverse order from which they were consumed. This, of course, will put the\nqueue over its configured ring-size. Therefore, since a ring queue\nprefers messages at the tail of the queue over messages at the head it will\nkeep B, C, & D and delete A (since A was the last message added\nto the head of the queue).\nTransaction or core session rollbacks are treated the same way.\nIf you wish to avoid these kinds of situations and you're using the core\nclient directly or the core JMS client you can minimize messages in delivery\nby reducing the size of consumerWindowSize (1024 * 1024 bytes by default).\nScheduled Messages\nWhen a scheduled message is sent to a queue it isn't immediately added to the\ntail of the queue like normal messages. It is held in an intermediate buffer\nand scheduled for delivery onto the head of the queue according to the\ndetails of the message. However, scheduled messages are nevertheless reflected\nin the message count of the queue. As with messages which are in delivery this\ncan make it appear that the ring queue's size is not being enforced. Consider\nthis simple scenario:\n\nQueue foo with ring-size=\"3\"\nAt 12:00 message A sent to foo scheduled for 12:05\nmessageCount=1, scheduledCount=1\nAt 12:01 message B sent to foo\nmessageCount=2, scheduledCount=1\nAt 12:02 message C sent to foo\nmessageCount=3, scheduledCount=1\nAt 12:03 message D sent to foo\nmessageCount=4, scheduledCount=1\n\nThe messageCount for foo is now 4, one greater than the ring-size of 3!\nHowever, the scheduled message is not technically on the queue yet (i.e. it is\non the broker and scheduled to be put on the queue). When the scheduled\ndelivery time for 12:05 comes the message will put on the head of the queue,\nbut since the ring queue's size has already been reach the scheduled message\nA will be removed.\nPaging\nSimilar to scheduled messages and messages in delivery, paged messages don't\ncount against a ring queue's size because messages are actually paged at the\naddress level, not the queue level. A paged message is not technically on a\nqueue although it is reflected in a queue's messageCount.\nIt is recommended that paging is not used for addresses with ring queues. In\nother words, ensure that the entire address will be able to fit into memory or\nuse the DROP, BLOCK or FAIL address-full-policy.\n"},"retroactive-addresses.html":{"url":"retroactive-addresses.html","title":"Retroactive Addresses","keywords":"","body":"Retroactive Addresses\nA \"retroactive\" address is an address that will preserve messages sent to it\nfor queues which will be created on it in the future. This can be useful in,\nfor example, publish-subscribe use cases where clients want to receive the\nmessages sent to the address before they they actually connected and created\ntheir multicast \"subscription\" queue. Typically messages sent to an address\nbefore a queue was created on it would simply be unavailable to those queues,\nbut with a retroactive address a fixed number of messages can be preserved by\nthe broker and automatically copied into queues subsequently created on the\naddress. This works for both anycast and multicast queues.\nInternal Retroactive Resources\nTo implement this functionality the broker will create 4 internal resources for\neach retroactive address:\n\nA non-exclusive divert to grab the messages from the retroactive\naddress.\nAn address to receive the messages from the divert.\nTwo ring queues to hold the messages sent to the address\nby the divert - one for anycast and one for multicast. The general caveats\nfor ring queues still apply here. See the chapter on ring queues\nfor more details.\n\nThese resources are important to be aware of as they will show up in the web\nconsole and other management or metric views. They will be named according to\nthe following pattern:\n(divert|address|queue(anycast|multicast))retro\nFor example, if an address named myAddress had a retroactive-message-count\nof 10 and the default internal-naming-prefix (i.e. $.artemis.internal.) and\nthe default delimiter (i.e. .) were being used then resources with these names\nwould be created:\n\nA divert on myAddress named $.artemis.internal.myAddress.divert.retro\nAn address named $.artemis.internal.myAddress.address.retro\nA multicast queue on the address from step #2 named\n$.artemis.internal.myAddress.queue.multicast.retro with a ring-size of 10.\nAn anycast queue on the address from step #2 named\n$.artemis.internal.myAddress.queue.anycast.retro with a ring-size of 10.\n\nThis pattern is important to note as it allows one to configure address-settings\nif necessary. To configure custom address-settings you'd use a match like:\n*.*.*..*.retro\nUsing the same example as above the match would be:\n*.*.*.myAddress.*.retro\n\nNote:\nChanging the broker's internal-naming-prefix once these retroactive\nresources are created will break the retroactive functionality.\n\nConfiguration\nTo configure an address to be \"retroactive\" simply configure the\nretroactive-message-count address-setting to reflect the number of messages\nyou want the broker to preserve, e.g.:\n\n   \n      100\n   \n\n\nThe value for retroactive-message-count can be updated at runtime either via\nbroker.xml or via the management API just like any other address-setting.\nHowever, if you reduce the value of retroactive-message-count an additional\nadministrative step will be required since this functionality is implemented\nvia ring queues. This is because a ring queue whose ring-size is reduced will\nnot automatically delete messages from the queue to meet the new ring-size in\norder to avoid unintended message loss. Therefore, administrative action will\nbe required in this case to manually reduce the number of messages in the ring\nqueue via the management API.\n"},"exclusive-queues.html":{"url":"exclusive-queues.html","title":"Exclusive Queues","keywords":"","body":"Exclusive Queues\nExclusive queues are special queues which route all messages to only one \nconsumer at a time.\nThis is useful when you want all messages to be processed serially by the same \nconsumer, when a producer does not specify Message Grouping.\nAn example might be orders sent to an address and you need to consume them \nin the exact same order they were produced.\nObviously exclusive queues have a draw back that you cannot scale out the \nconsumers to improve consumption as only one consumer would technically be active. \nHere we advise that you look at message groups first.\nConfiguring Exclusive Queues\nExclusive queues can be statically configured using the exclusive boolean \nproperty:\n\n   \n      \n   \n\n\nSpecified on creating a Queue by using the CORE api specifying the parameter \nexclusive to true. \nOr on auto-create when using the JMS Client by using address parameters when \ncreating the destination used by the consumer.\nQueue queue = session.createQueue(\"my.destination.name?exclusive=true\");\nTopic topic = session.createTopic(\"my.destination.name?exclusive=true\");\n\nAlso the default for all queues under and address can be defaulted using the \naddress-setting configuration:\n\n   true\n\n\nBy default, default-exclusive-queue is false. Address \nwildcards can be used to configure exclusive queues for a \nset of addresses.\nExample\nSee the exclusive queue example which shows how \nexclusive queues are configured and used with JMS.\n"},"message-grouping.html":{"url":"message-grouping.html","title":"Message Grouping","keywords":"","body":"Message Grouping\nMessage groups are sets of messages that have the following characteristics:\n\nMessages in a message group share the same group id, i.e. they have same\ngroup identifier property (JMSXGroupID for JMS, _AMQ_GROUP_ID for Apache\nActiveMQ Artemis Core API).\n\nMessages in a message group are always consumed by the same consumer, even if\nthere are many consumers on a queue. They pin all messages with the same\ngroup id to the same consumer. If that consumer closes another consumer is\nchosen and will receive all messages with the same group id.\n\n\nMessage groups are useful when you want all messages for a certain value of the\nproperty to be processed serially by the same consumer.\nAn example might be orders for a certain stock. You may want orders for any\nparticular stock to be processed serially by the same consumer. To do this you\ncan create a pool of consumers (perhaps one for each stock, but less will work\ntoo), then set the stock name as the value of the _AMQ_GROUP_ID property.\nThis will ensure that all messages for a particular stock will always be\nprocessed by the same consumer.\n\nNote:\nGrouped messages can impact the concurrent processing of non-grouped messages\ndue to the underlying FIFO semantics of a queue. For example, if there is a\nchunk of 100 grouped messages at the head of a queue followed by 1,000\nnon-grouped messages then all the grouped messages will need to be sent to\nthe appropriate client (which is consuming those grouped messages serially)\nbefore any of the non-grouped messages can be consumed. The functional impact\nin this scenario is a temporary suspension of concurrent message processing\nwhile all the grouped messages are processed. This can be a performance\nbottleneck so keep it in mind when determining the size of your message\ngroups, and consider whether or not you should isolate your grouped messages\nfrom your non-grouped messages.\n\nUsing Core API\nThe property name used to identify the message group is \"_AMQ_GROUP_ID\" (or\nthe constant MessageImpl.HDR_GROUP_ID). Alternatively, you can set\nautogroup to true on the SessionFactory which will pick a random unique id.\nUsing JMS\nThe property name used to identify the message group is JMSXGroupID.\n// send 2 messages in the same group to ensure the same\n// consumer will receive both\nMessage message = ...\nmessage.setStringProperty(\"JMSXGroupID\", \"Group-0\");\nproducer.send(message);\n\nmessage = ...\nmessage.setStringProperty(\"JMSXGroupID\", \"Group-0\");\nproducer.send(message);\n\nAlternatively, you can set autogroup to true on the\nActiveMQConnectonFactory which will pick a random unique id. This can also be\nset in the JNDI context environment, e.g. jndi.properties.  Here's a simple\nexample using the \"ConnectionFactory\" connection factory which is available in\nthe context by default\njava.naming.factory.initial=org.apache.activemq.artemis.jndi.ActiveMQInitialContextFactory\nconnectionFactory.myConnectionFactory=tcp://localhost:61616?autoGroup=true\n\nAlternatively you can set the group id via the connection factory. All messages\nsent with producers created via this connection factory will set the\nJMSXGroupID to the specified value on all messages sent. This can also be set\nin the JNDI context environment, e.g. jndi.properties.  Here's a simple\nexample using the \"ConnectionFactory\" connection factory which is available in\nthe context by default:\njava.naming.factory.initial=org.apache.activemq.artemis.jndi.ActiveMQInitialContextFactory\nconnectionFactory.myConnectionFactory=tcp://localhost:61616?groupID=Group-0\n\nClosing a Message Group\nYou generally don't need to close a message group, you just keep using it. \nHowever if you really do want to close a group you can add a negative sequence number.\nExample:\nMesasge message = session.createTextMessage(\"hey\");\nmessage.setStringProperty(\"JMSXGroupID\", \"Group-0\");\nmessage.setIntProperty(\"JMSXGroupSeq\", -1);\n...\nproducer.send(message);\n\nThis then closes the message group so if another message is sent in the future with the same message group ID it will be reassigned to a new consumer.\nNotifying Consumer of Group Ownership change\nActiveMQ supports putting a boolean header, set on the first message sent to a consumer for a particular message group.\nTo enable this, you must set a header key that the broker will use to set the flag.\nIn the examples we use JMSXGroupFirstForConsumer but it can be any header key value you want.\nBy setting group-first-key to JMSXGroupFirstForConsumer at the queue level, every time a new group is assigned a consumer the header JMSXGroupFirstForConsumer will be set to true on the first message.\n\n   \n      \n   \n\n\nOr on auto-create when using the JMS Client by using address parameters when \ncreating the destination used by the consumer.\nQueue queue = session.createQueue(\"my.destination.name?group-first-key=JMSXGroupFirstForConsumer\");\nTopic topic = session.createTopic(\"my.destination.name?group-first-key=JMSXGroupFirstForConsumer\");\n\nAlso the default for all queues under and address can be defaulted using the \naddress-setting configuration:\n\n   JMSXGroupFirstForConsumer\n\n\nBy default this is null, and therefor OFF. \nRebalancing Message Groups\nSometimes after new consumers are added you can find that if you have long lived groups, that they have no groups assigned, and thus are not being utilised, this is because the long lived groups will already be assigned to existing consumers.\nIt is possibly to rebalance the groups.\nnote during the split moment of reset, a message to the original associated consumer could be in flight at the same time, a new message for the same group is dispatched to the new associated consumer.\nManually\nvia the management API or managment console by invoking resetAllGroups\nAutomatically\nBy setting group-rebalance to true at the queue level, every time a consumer is added it will trigger a rebalance/reset of the groups.\nAs noted above, when group rebalance is done, there is a risk you may have inflight messages being processed, by default the broker will continue to dispatch whilst rebalance is occuring. To ensure that inflight messages are processed before dispatch of new messages post rebalance, \nto different consumers, you can set group-rebalance-pause-dispatch to true which will cause the dispatch to pause whilst rebalance occurs, until all inflight messages are processed.   \n\n   \n      \n   \n\n\nOr on auto-create when using the JMS Client by using address parameters when \ncreating the destination used by the consumer.\nQueue queue = session.createQueue(\"my.destination.name?group-rebalance=true&group-rebalance-pause-dispatch=true\");\nTopic topic = session.createTopic(\"my.destination.name?group-rebalance=true&group-rebalance-pause-dispatch=true\");\n\nAlso the default for all queues under and address can be defaulted using the \naddress-setting configuration:\n\n   true\n   true\n\n\nBy default, default-group-rebalance is false meaning this is disabled/off.\nBy default, default-group-rebalance-pause-dispatch is false meaning this is disabled/off.\nGroup Buckets\nFor handling groups in a queue with bounded memory allowing better scaling of groups, \nyou can enable group buckets, essentially the group id is hashed into a bucket instead of keeping track of every single group id.\nSetting group-buckets to -1 keeps default behaviour which means the queue keeps track of every group but suffers from unbounded memory use.\nSetting group-buckets to 0 disables grouping (0 buckets), on a queue. This can be useful on a multicast address, \nwhere many queues exist but one queue you may not care for ordering and prefer to keep round robin behaviour.\nThere is a number of ways to set group-buckets.\n\n   \n      \n   \n\n\nSpecified on creating a Queue by using the CORE api specifying the parameter \ngroup-buckets to 20. \nOr on auto-create when using the JMS Client by using address parameters when \ncreating the destination used by the consumer.\nQueue queue = session.createQueue(\"my.destination.name?group-buckets=1024\");\nTopic topic = session.createTopic(\"my.destination.name?group-buckets=1024\");\n\nAlso the default for all queues under and address can be defaulted using the \naddress-setting configuration:\n\n   1024\n\n\nBy default, default-group-buckets is -1 this is to keep compatibility with existing default behaviour. \nAddress wildcards can be used to configure group-buckets for a \nset of addresses.\nExample\nSee the Message Group Example which shows how\nmessage groups are configured and used with JMS and via a connection factory.\nClustered Grouping\nUsing message groups in a cluster is a bit more complex. This is because\nmessages with a particular group id can arrive on any node so each node needs\nto know about which group id's are bound to which consumer on which node. The\nconsumer handling messages for a particular group id may be on a different node\nof the cluster, so each node needs to know this information so it can route the\nmessage correctly to the node which has that consumer.\nTo solve this there is the notion of a grouping handler. Each node will have\nits own grouping handler and when a messages is sent with a group id assigned,\nthe handlers will decide between them which route the message should take.\nHere is a sample config for each type of handler. This should be configured in\nbroker.xml.\n\n   LOCAL\n   jms\n   5000\n\n\n\n   REMOTE\n   jms\n   5000\n\n\n\ntype two types of handlers are supported - LOCAL and REMOTE.  Each\ncluster should choose 1 node to have a LOCAL grouping handler and all the\nother nodes should have REMOTE handlers. It's the LOCAL handler that\nactually makes the decision as to what route should be used, all the other\nREMOTE handlers converse with this. \n\naddress refers to a cluster connection and the address it\nuses. Refer to the clustering\nsection on how to configure clusters.\n\ntimeout how long to wait for a decision to be made. An exception will be\nthrown during the send if this timeout is reached, this ensures that strict\nordering is kept.\n\n\nThe decision as to where a message should be routed to is initially proposed by\nthe node that receives the message. The node will pick a suitable route as per\nthe normal clustered routing conditions, i.e.  round robin available queues,\nuse a local queue first and choose a queue that has a consumer. If the proposal\nis accepted by the grouping handlers the node will route messages to this queue\nfrom that point on, if rejected an alternative route will be offered and the\nnode will again route to that queue indefinitely. All other nodes will also\nroute to the queue chosen at proposal time. Once the message arrives at the\nqueue then normal single server message group semantics take over and the\nmessage is pinned to a consumer on that queue.\nYou may have noticed that there is a single point of failure with the single\nlocal handler. If this node crashes then no decisions will be able to be made.\nAny messages sent will be not be delivered and an exception thrown. To avoid\nthis happening Local Handlers can be replicated on another backup node. Simple\ncreate your back up node and configure it with the same Local handler.\nClustered Grouping Best Practices\nSome best practices should be followed when using clustered grouping:\n\nMake sure your consumers are distributed evenly across the different nodes\nif possible. This is only an issue if you are creating and closing\nconsumers regularly. Since messages are always routed to the same queue once\npinned, removing a consumer from this queue may leave it with no consumers\nmeaning the queue will just keep receiving the messages. Avoid closing\nconsumers or make sure that you always have plenty of consumers, i.e., if you\nhave 3 nodes have 3 consumers.\n\nUse durable queues if possible. If queues are removed once a group is bound\nto it, then it is possible that other nodes may still try to route messages\nto it. This can be avoided by making sure that the queue is deleted by the\nsession that is sending the messages. This means that when the next message is\nsent it is sent to the node where the queue was deleted meaning a new proposal\ncan successfully take place. Alternatively you could just start using a\ndifferent group id.\n\nAlways make sure that the node that has the Local Grouping Handler is\nreplicated. These means that on failover grouping will still occur.\n\nIn case you are using group-timeouts, the remote node should have a smaller\ngroup-timeout with at least half of the value on the main coordinator. This\nis because this will determine how often the last-time-use value should be\nupdated with a round trip for a request to the group between the nodes.\n\n\nClustered Grouping Example\nSee the Clustered Grouping Example which\nshows how to configure message groups with a ActiveMQ Artemis Cluster.\n"},"consumer-priority.html":{"url":"consumer-priority.html","title":"Consumer Priority","keywords":"","body":"Consumer Priority\nConsumer priorities allow you to ensure that high priority consumers receive messages while they are active.\nNormally, active consumers connected to a queue receive messages from it in a round-robin fashion. When consumer priorities are in use, messages are delivered round-robin if multiple active consumers exist with the same high priority.\nMessages will only going to lower priority consumers when the high priority consumers do not have credit available to consume the message, or those high priority consumers have declined to accept the message (for instance because it does not meet the criteria of any selectors associated with the consumer).\nWhere a consumer does not set, the default priority 0 is used.\nCore\nJMS Example\nWhen using the JMS Client you can set the priority to be used, by using address parameters when \ncreating the destination used by the consumer.\nQueue queue = session.createQueue(\"my.destination.name?consumer-priority=50\");\nTopic topic = session.createTopic(\"my.destination.name?consumer-priority=50\");\n\nconsumer = session.createConsumer(queue);\n\nThe range of priority values is -231 to 231-1.\nOpenWire\nJMS Example\nThe priority for a consumer is set using Destination Options as follows:\nqueue = new ActiveMQQueue(\"TEST.QUEUE?consumer.priority=10\");\nconsumer = session.createConsumer(queue);\n\nBecause of the limitation of OpenWire, the range of priority values is: 0 to 127. The highest priority is 127.\nAMQP\nIn AMQP 1.0 the priority of the consumer is set in the properties map of the attach frame where the broker side of the link represents the sending side of the link. \nThe key for the entry must be the literal string priority, and the value of the entry must be an integral number in the range -231 to 231-1.\n"},"pre-acknowledge.html":{"url":"pre-acknowledge.html","title":"Extra Acknowledge Modes","keywords":"","body":"Extra Acknowledge Modes\nJMS specifies 3 acknowledgement modes:\n\nAUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE\n\nCLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE\n\nDUPS_OK_ACKNOWLEDGE\n\n\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis supports two additional modes: PRE_ACKNOWLEDGE and\nINDIVIDUAL_ACKNOWLEDGE\nIn some cases you can afford to lose messages in event of failure, so it\nwould make sense to acknowledge the message on the server before\ndelivering it to the client.\nThis extra mode is supported by Apache ActiveMQ Artemis and will call it\npre-acknowledge mode.\nThe disadvantage of acknowledging on the server before delivery is that\nthe message will be lost if the system crashes after acknowledging the\nmessage on the server but before it is delivered to the client. In\nthat case, the message is lost and will not be recovered when the system\nrestart.\nDepending on your messaging case, preAcknowledgement mode can avoid\nextra network traffic and CPU at the cost of coping with message loss.\nAn example of a use case for pre-acknowledgement is for stock price\nupdate messages. With these messages it might be reasonable to lose a\nmessage in event of crash, since the next price update message will\narrive soon, overriding the previous price.\n\nNote:\nPlease note, that if you use pre-acknowledge mode, then you will lose\ntransactional semantics for messages being consumed, since clearly\nthey are being acknowledged first on the server, not when you commit\nthe transaction. This may be stating the obvious but we like to be\nclear on these things to avoid confusion!\n\nUsing PRE_ACKNOWLEDGE\nThis can be configured by setting the boolean URL parameter preAcknowledge\nto true.\nAlternatively, when using the JMS API, create a JMS Session with the\nActiveMQSession.PRE_ACKNOWLEDGE constant.\n// messages will be acknowledge on the server *before* being delivered to the client\nSession session = connection.createSession(false, ActiveMQJMSConstants.PRE_ACKNOWLEDGE);\n\nIndividual Acknowledge\nA valid use-case for individual acknowledgement would be when you need\nto have your own scheduling and you don't know when your message\nprocessing will be finished. You should prefer having one consumer per\nthread worker but this is not possible in some circumstances depending\non how complex is your processing. For that you can use the individual\nacknowledgement.\nYou basically setup Individual ACK by creating a session with the\nacknowledge mode with ActiveMQJMSConstants.INDIVIDUAL_ACKNOWLEDGE.\nIndividual ACK inherits all the semantics from Client Acknowledge, with\nthe exception the message is individually acked.\n\nNote:\nPlease note, that to avoid confusion on MDB processing, Individual\nACKNOWLEDGE is not supported through MDBs (or the inbound resource\nadapter). this is because you have to finish the process of your\nmessage inside the MDB.\n\nExample\nSee the Pre-acknowledge Example which shows how \nto use pre-acknowledgement mode with JMS.\n"},"management.html":{"url":"management.html","title":"Management","keywords":"","body":"Management\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis has an extensive management API that allows a user to\nmodify a server configuration, create new resources (e.g. addresses and\nqueues), inspect these resources (e.g. how many messages are currently held in\na queue) and interact with it (e.g. to remove messages from a queue). Apache\nActiveMQ Artemis also allows clients to subscribe to management notifications.\nThere are four ways to access Apache ActiveMQ Artemis management API:\n\nUsing JMX -- JMX is the standard way to manage Java applications\n\nUsing Jolokia -- Jolokia exposes the JMX API of an application through a\nREST interface\n\nUsing the Core Client -- management operations are sent to Apache ActiveMQ\nArtemis server using Core Client messages\n\nUsing any JMS Client -- management operations are sent to Apache ActiveMQ \nArtemis server using JMS Client messages\n\n\nAlthough there are four different ways to manage Apache ActiveMQ Artemis, each\nAPI supports the same functionality. If it is possible to manage a resource\nusing JMX it is also possible to achieve the same result using Core messages.\nBesides these four management interfaces, a Web Console \nand a Command Line management utility are also available to administrators of \nActiveMQ Artemis.\nThe choice depends on your requirements, your application settings, and your\nenvironment to decide which way suits you best.\n\nNote:\nIn version 2 of Apache ActiveMQ Artemis the syntax used for MBean Object\nnames has changed significantly due to changes in the addressing scheme. See\nthe documentation for each individual resource for details on the new syntax.\n\nThe Management API\nRegardless of the way you invoke management operations, the management API is\nthe same.\nFor each managed resource, there exists a Java interface describing what\noperations can be invoked for this type of resource.\nTo learn about available management operations, see the Javadoc for these\ninterfaces. They are located in the\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.api.core.management package and they are named\nwith the word Control at the end.\nThe way to invoke management operations depends on whether JMX, Core messages,\nor JMS messages are used.\nManagement API\nFor full details of the API please consult the Javadoc. In summary:\nServer Management\nThe ActiveMQServerControl interface is the entry point for broker management.\n\nListing, creating, deploying and destroying queues\nA list of deployed queues can be retrieved using the getQueueNames()\nmethod.\nQueues can be created or destroyed using the management operations\ncreateQueue() or deployQueue() or destroyQueue().\ncreateQueue will fail if the queue already exists while deployQueue will\ndo nothing.\n\nListing and closing remote connections\nClient's remote addresses can be retrieved using listRemoteAddresses(). It\nis also possible to close the connections associated with a remote address\nusing the closeConnectionsForAddress() method.\nAlternatively, connection IDs can be listed using listConnectionIDs() and\nall the sessions for a given connection ID can be listed using\nlistSessions().\n\nTransaction heuristic operations\nIn case of a server crash, when the server restarts, it it possible that some\ntransaction requires manual intervention. The listPreparedTransactions()\nmethod lists the transactions which are in the prepared states (the\ntransactions are represented as opaque Base64 Strings.) To commit or rollback a\ngiven prepared transaction, the commitPreparedTransaction() or\nrollbackPreparedTransaction() method can be used to resolve heuristic\ntransactions. Heuristically completed transactions can be listed using the\nlistHeuristicCommittedTransactions() and\nlistHeuristicRolledBackTransactions methods.\n\nEnabling and resetting Message counters\nMessage counters can be enabled or disabled using the\nenableMessageCounters() or disableMessageCounters() method. To reset\nmessage counters, it is possible to invoke resetAllMessageCounters() and\nresetAllMessageCounterHistories() methods.\n\nRetrieving the server configuration and attributes\nThe ActiveMQServerControl exposes Apache ActiveMQ Artemis server\nconfiguration through all its attributes (e.g. getVersion() method to\nretrieve the server's version, etc.)\n\nListing, creating and destroying Core bridges and diverts\nA list of deployed core bridges (resp. diverts) can be retrieved using the\ngetBridgeNames() (resp. getDivertNames()) method.\nCore bridges (resp. diverts) can be created or destroyed using the management\noperations createBridge() and destroyBridge() (resp.  createDivert() and\ndestroyDivert()).\nDiverts can be updated using the management operation updateDivert().\n\nIt is possible to stop the server and force failover to occur with any\ncurrently attached clients.\nTo do this use the forceFailover() operation. \n\nNote:\nSince this method actually stops the server you will probably receive some\nsort of error depending on which management service you use to call it.\n\n\n\nAddress Management\nIndividual addresses can be managed using the AddressControl interface.\n\nModifying roles and permissions for an address\nYou can add or remove roles associated to a queue using the addRole() or\nremoveRole() methods. You can list all the roles associated to the queue with\nthe getRoles() method\n\nPausing and resuming Address\nThe AddressControl can pause and resume an address and all the queues that\nare bound to it. Newly added queue will be paused too until the address is resumed.\nThus all messages sent to the address will be recived but not delivered. When it is\nresumed, delivering will occur again.\n\n\nQueue Management\nThe bulk of the management API deals with queues. The QueueControl interface\ndefines the queue management operations.\nMost of the management operations on queues take either a single message ID\n(e.g. to remove a single message) or a filter (e.g. to expire all messages with\na given property.)\n\nNote:\nPassing null or an empty string in the filter parameter means that the\nmanagement operation will be performed on all messages in a queue.\n\n\nExpiring, sending to a dead letter address and moving messages\nMessages can be expired from a queue by using the expireMessages() method.\nIf an expiry address is defined, messages will be sent to it, otherwise they\nare discarded.\nMessages can also be sent to a dead letter address with the\nsendMessagesToDeadLetterAddress() method. It returns the number of messages\nwhich are sent to the dead letter address. If a dead letter address is not\ndefined, message are removed from the queue and discarded.\nMessages can also be moved from a queue to another queue by using the\nmoveMessages() method.\n\nListing and removing messages\nMessages can be listed from a queue by using the listMessages() method\nwhich returns an array of Map, one Map for each message.\nMessages can also be removed from the queue by using the removeMessages()\nmethod which returns a boolean for the single message ID variant or the\nnumber of removed messages for the filter variant. The removeMessages()\nmethod takes a filter argument to remove only filtered messages. Setting the\nfilter to an empty string will in effect remove all messages.\n\nCounting messages\nThe number of messages in a queue is returned by the getMessageCount()\nmethod. Alternatively, the countMessages() will return the number of messages\nin the queue which match a given filter.\n\nChanging message priority\nThe message priority can be changed by using the changeMessagesPriority()\nmethod which returns a boolean for the single message ID variant or the\nnumber of updated messages for the filter variant.\n\nMessage counters\nMessage counters can be listed for a queue with the listMessageCounter()\nand listMessageCounterHistory() methods (see Message Counters section). The\nmessage counters can also be reset for a single queue using the\nresetMessageCounter() method.\n\nRetrieving the queue attributes\nThe QueueControl exposes queue settings through its attributes (e.g.\ngetFilter() to retrieve the queue's filter if it was created with one,\nisDurable() to know whether the queue is durable or not, etc.)\n\nPausing and resuming Queues\nThe QueueControl can pause and resume the underlying queue. When a queue is\npaused, it will receive messages but will not deliver them.  When it's resumed,\nit'll begin delivering the queued messages, if any.\n\nDisabling and Enabling Queues\nThe QueueControl can disable and enable the underlying queue. When a queue is\ndisabled, it will not longer have messages routed to it.  When it's enabled,\nit'll begin having messages routed to it again. \nThis is useful where you may need to disable message routing to a queue but wish to keep consumers active\nto investigate issues, without causing further message build up in the queue.\n\n\nOther Resources Management\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis allows to start and stop its remote resources\n(acceptors, diverts, bridges, etc.) so that a server can be taken off line for\na given period of time without stopping it completely (e.g. if other management\noperations must be performed such as resolving heuristic transactions). These\nresources are:\n\nAcceptors\nThey can be started or stopped using the start() or. stop() method on the\nAcceptorControl interface. The acceptors parameters can be retrieved using\nthe AcceptorControl attributes (see Understanding\nAcceptors)\n\nDiverts\nThey can be started or stopped using the start() or stop() method on the\nDivertControl interface. Diverts parameters can be retrieved using the\nDivertControl attributes (see Diverting and Splitting Message\nFlows))\n\nBridges\nThey can be started or stopped using the start() (resp. stop()) method on\nthe BridgeControl interface. Bridges parameters can be retrieved using the\nBridgeControl attributes (see Core bridges)\n\nBroadcast groups\nThey can be started or stopped using the start() or stop() method on the\nBroadcastGroupControl interface. Broadcast groups parameters can be retrieved\nusing the BroadcastGroupControl attributes (see Clusters)\n\nCluster connections\nThey can be started or stopped using the start() or stop() method on the\nClusterConnectionControl interface. Cluster connections parameters can be\nretrieved using the ClusterConnectionControl attributes (see\nClusters)\n\n\nUsing Management Via JMX\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis can be managed using\nJMX.\nThe management API is exposed by Apache ActiveMQ Artemis using MBeans\ninterfaces.  Apache ActiveMQ Artemis registers its resources with the domain\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.\nFor example, the ObjectName to manage the anycast queue exampleQueue on the\naddress exampleAddress is:\norg.apache.activemq.artemis:broker=,component=addresses,address=\"exampleAddress\",subcomponent=queues,routing-type=\"anycast\",queue=\"exampleQueue\"\nand the MBean is:\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.api.core.management.QueueControl\nThe MBean ObjectName's are built using the helper class\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.api.core.management.ObjectNameBuilder. You can\nalso use jconsole to find the ObjectName of the MBean you want to manage.\nExample usage of the ObjectNameBuilder to obtain ActiveMQServerControl's name:\nbrokerName = \"0.0.0.0\";  // configured e.g. in broker.xml  element\nobjectNameBuilder = ObjectNameBuilder.create(ArtemisResolver.DEFAULT_DOMAIN, brokerName, true);\nserverObjectName = objectNameBuilder.getActiveMQServerObjectName()\n\nManaging Apache ActiveMQ Artemis using JMX is identical to management of any\nJava Applications using JMX. It can be done by reflection or by creating\nproxies of the MBeans.\nConfiguring JMX\nBy default, JMX is enabled to manage Apache ActiveMQ Artemis. It can be\ndisabled by setting jmx-management-enabled to false in broker.xml:\n\nfalse\n\nRole Based Authorisation for JMX\nAlthough by default Artemis uses the Java Virtual Machine's Platform\nMBeanServer this is guarded using role based authentication that leverages\nArtemis's JAAS plugin support.  This is configured via the authorisation\nelement in the management.xml configuration file and can be used to restrict\naccess to attributes and methods on mbeans.\nThere are 3 elements within the authorisation element, whitelist,\ndefault-access and role-access, Lets discuss each in turn.\nWhitelist contains a list of mBeans that will by pass the authentication, this\nis typically used for any mbeans that are needed by the console to run etc. The\ndefault configuration is:\n\n   \n\n\nThis means that any mbean with the domain hawtio will be allowed access\nwithout authorisation. for instance hawtio:plugin=artemis. You can also use\nwildcards for the mBean properties so the following would also match.\n\n   \n\n\nThe role-accessdefines how roles are mapped to particular mBeans and its\nattributes and methods, the default configuration looks like:\n\n  \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n  \n\n\nThis contains 1 match and will be applied to any mBean that has the domain\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.  Any access to any mBeans that have this domain\nare controlled by the access elements which contain a method and a set of\nroles. The method being invoked will be used to pick the closest matching\nmethod and the roles for this will be applied for access. For instance if you\ntry the invoke a method called listMessages on an mBean with the\norg.apache.activemq.artemis domain then this would match the access with\nthe method of list*.  You could also explicitly configure this by using the\nfull method name, like so:\n\n\nYou can also match specific mBeans within a domain by adding a key attribute\nthat is used to match one of the properties on the mBean, like:\n\n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n\n\nYou could also match a specific queue for instance:\norg.apache.activemq.artemis:broker=,component=addresses,address=\"exampleAddress\",subcomponent=queues,routing-type=\"anycast\",queue=\"exampleQueue\"\nby configuring:\n\n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n\n\nYou can also use wildcards for the mBean properties so the following would\nalso match, allowing prefix match for the mBean properties.\n\n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n\n\nIn case of multiple matches, the exact matches have higher priority than the\nwildcard matches and the longer wildcard matches have higher priority than the\nshorter wildcard matches.\nAccess to JMX mBean attributes are converted to method calls so these are\ncontrolled via the set*, get* and is*.  The * access is the catch all\nfor everything other method that isn't specifically matched.\nThe default-access element is basically the catch all for every method call\nthat isn't handled via the role-access configuration.  This has the same\nsemantics as a match element.\n\nNote:\nIf JMX is enabled, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis can not be managed locally using\njconsole when connecting as a local process, this is because jconsole does\nnot using any authentication when connecting this way. If you want to use\njconsole you will either have to disable authentication, by removing the\nauthentication element or enable remote access.\n\nConfiguring remote JMX Access\nBy default remote JMX access to Artemis is disabled for security reasons.\nArtemis has a JMX agent which allows access to JMX mBeans remotely. This is\nconfigured via the connector element in the management.xml configuration\nfile. To enable this you simply add the following xml:\n\n\nThis exposes the agent remotely on the port 1099. If you were connecting via\njconsole you would connect as a remote process using the service url\nservice:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:1099/jmxrmi and an appropriate user\nname and password.\nYou can also configure the connector using the following:\n\nconnector-host\nThe host to expose the agent on.\n\nconnector-port\nThe port to expose the agent on.\n\nrmi-registry-port\nThe port that the RMI registry binds to. If not set, the port is\nalways random. Set to avoid problems with remote JMX connections\ntunnelled through firewall.\n\njmx-realm\nThe jmx realm to use for authentication, defaults to activemq to match the\nJAAS configuration.\n\nobject-name\nThe object name to expose the remote connector on; default is\nconnector:name=rmi.\n\nsecured\nWhether the connector is secured using SSL.\n\nkey-store-path\nThe location of the keystore.\n\nkey-store-password\nThe keystore password. This can be masked.\n\nkey-store-provider\nThe provider; JKS by default.\n\ntrust-store-path\nThe location of the truststore.\n\ntrust-store-password\nThe trustore password. This can be masked.\n\ntrust-store-provider\nThe provider; JKS by default.\n\npassword-codec\nThe fully qualified class name of the password codec to use. See the\npassword masking documentation for more details on\nhow this works.\n\n\n\nNote:\nIt is important to note that the rmi registry will pick an ip address to bind\nto, If you have a multi IP addresses/NICs  present on the system then you can\nchoose the ip address to use by adding the following to artemis.profile\n-Djava.rmi.server.hostname=localhost\nNote:\nRemote connections using the default JVM Agent not enabled by default as\nArtemis exposes the mBean Server via its own configuration.  This is so\nArtemis can leverage the JAAS authentication layer via JMX. If you want to\nexpose this then you will need to disable both the connector and the\nauthorisation by removing them from the management.xml configuration.\nPlease refer to Java Management\nguide\nto configure the server for remote management (system properties must be set\nin artemis.profile).\n\nBy default, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis server uses the JMX domain\n\"org.apache.activemq.artemis\".  To manage several Apache ActiveMQ Artemis\nservers from the same MBeanServer, the JMX domain can be configured for each\nindividual Apache ActiveMQ Artemis server by setting jmx-domain in\nbroker.xml:\n\nmy.org.apache.activemq\n\nExample\nSee the JMX Management Example which shows how to\nuse a remote connection to JMX and MBean proxies to manage Apache ActiveMQ\nArtemis.\nExposing JMX using Jolokia\nThe default Broker configuration ships with the Jolokia\nHTTP agent deployed as a web application. Jolokia is a remote JMX-over-HTTP\nbridge that exposes MBeans. For a full guide as to how to use it refer to\nJolokia Documentation, however a\nsimple example to query the broker's version would be to use a browser and go\nto the URL\nhttp://username:password@localhost:8161/console/jolokia/read/org.apache.activemq.artemis:broker=\"0.0.0.0\"/Version.\nThis would give you back something like the following:\n{\"request\":{\"mbean\":\"org.apache.activemq.artemis:broker=\\\"0.0.0.0\\\"\",\"attribute\":\"Version\",\"type\":\"read\"},\"value\":\"2.0.0-SNAPSHOT\",\"timestamp\":1487017918,\"status\":200}\nJMX and the Console\nThe console that ships with Artemis uses Jolokia under the covers which in turn\nuses JMX. This will use the authentication configuration in the\nmanagement.xml file as described in the previous section. This means that\nwhen mBeans are accessed via the console the credentials used to log into the\nconsole and the roles associated with them. By default access to the console is\nonly allow via users with the amq role. This is configured in the\nartemis.profile via the system property -Dhawtio.role=amq.  You can\nconfigure multiple roles by changing this to -Dhawtio.roles=amq,view,update.\nIf a user doesn't have the correct role to invoke a specific operation then\nthis will display an authorisation exception in the console. \nUsing Management Message API\nThe management message API in ActiveMQ Artemis is accessed by sending Core\nClient messages to a special address, the management address.\nManagement messages are regular Core Client messages with well-known\nproperties that the server needs to understand to interact with the management\nAPI:\n\nThe name of the managed resource\n\nThe name of the management operation\n\nThe parameters of the management operation\n\n\nWhen such a management message is sent to the management address, Apache\nActiveMQ Artemis server will handle it, extract the information, invoke the\noperation on the managed resources and send a management reply to the\nmanagement message's reply-to address (specified by\nClientMessageImpl.REPLYTO_HEADER_NAME).\nA ClientConsumer can be used to consume the management reply and retrieve the\nresult of the operation (if any) stored in the reply's body. For portability,\nresults are returned as a JSON String rather than Java\nSerialization (the\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.api.core.management.ManagementHelper can be used\nto convert the JSON string to Java objects).\nThese steps can be simplified to make it easier to invoke management operations\nusing Core messages:\n\nCreate a ClientRequestor to send messages to the management address and\nreceive replies\n\nCreate a ClientMessage\n\nUse the helper class\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.api.core.management.ManagementHelper to fill\nthe message with the management properties\n\nSend the message using the ClientRequestor\n\nUse the helper class\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.api.core.management.ManagementHelper to\nretrieve the operation result from the management reply.\n\n\nFor example, to find out the number of messages in the queue exampleQueue:\nClientSession session = ...\nClientRequestor requestor = new ClientRequestor(session, \"activemq.management\");\nClientMessage message = session.createMessage(false);\nManagementHelper.putAttribute(message, \"queue.exampleQueue\", \"messageCount\");\nsession.start();\nClientMessage reply = requestor.request(m);\nint count = (Integer) ManagementHelper.getResult(reply);\nSystem.out.println(\"There are \" + count + \" messages in exampleQueue\");\n\nManagement operation name and parameters must conform to the Java interfaces\ndefined in the management packages.\nNames of the resources are built using the helper class\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.api.core.management.ResourceNames and are\nstraightforward (e.g. queue.exampleQueue for QueueControl of the Queue\nexampleQueue, or broker for the ActiveMQServerControl).\n\nNote:\nThe ManagementHelper class can be used only with Core JMS messages.  When\ncalled with a message from a different JMS library, an exception will be\nthrown.\n\nConfiguring Management\nThe management address to send management messages is configured in\nbroker.xml:\nactivemq.management\n\nBy default, the address is activemq.management.\nThe management address requires a special user permission manage to be able\nto receive and handle management messages. This is also configured in\nbroker.xml:\n\n\n\n   \n\n\nExample\nSee the Management Example which shows how to use JMS\nmessages to manage the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis server.\nManagement Notifications\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis emits notifications to inform listeners of\npotentially interesting events (creation of new resources, security violation,\netc.).\nThese notifications can be received by two different ways:\n\nJMX notifications\n\nNotification messages\n\n\nJMX Notifications\nIf JMX is enabled (see Configuring JMX section), JMX notifications can be\nreceived by subscribing to\norg.apache.activemq.artemis:type=Broker,brokerName=,module=Core,serviceType=Server for notifications on resources.\nNotification Messages\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis defines a special management notification address.\nQueues can be bound to this address so that clients will receive management\nnotifications as messages.\nA client which wants to receive management notifications must create a queue\nbound to the management notification address. It can then receive the\nnotifications from its queue.\nNotifications messages are regular messages with additional properties\ncorresponding to the notification (its type, when it occurred, the resources\nwhich were concerned, etc.).\nSince notifications are regular messages, it is possible to use message\nselectors to filter out notifications and receives only a subset of all the\nnotifications emitted by the server.\nConfiguring The Management Notification Address\nThe management notification address to receive management notifications is\nconfigured in broker.xml:\nactivemq.notifications\n\nBy default, the address is activemq.notifications.\nReceiving Notification Messages\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis's Core JMS Client can be used to receive notifications:\nTopic notificationsTopic = ActiveMQJMSClient.createTopic(\"activemq.notifications\");\n\nSession session = ...\nMessageConsumer notificationConsumer = session.createConsumer(notificationsTopic);\nnotificationConsumer.setMessageListener(new MessageListener() {\n   public void onMessage(Message notif) {\n    System.out.println(\"------------------------\");\n    System.out.println(\"Received notification:\");\n    try {\n     Enumeration propertyNames = notif.getPropertyNames();\n     while (propertyNames.hasMoreElements()) {\n      String propertyName = (String)propertyNames.nextElement();\n      System.out.format(\"  %s: %s\\n\", propertyName, notif.getObjectProperty(propertyName));\n     }\n    } catch (JMSException e) {\n    }\n    System.out.println(\"------------------------\");\n   }\n});\n\nExample\nSee the Management Notification Example\nwhich shows how to use a JMS MessageListener to receive management\nnotifications from ActiveMQ Artemis server.\nNotification Types and Headers\nBelow is a list of all the different kinds of notifications as well as which\nheaders are on the messages. Every notification has a _AMQ_NotifType (value\nnoted in parentheses) and _AMQ_NotifTimestamp header. The timestamp is the\nun-formatted result of a call to java.lang.System.currentTimeMillis().\n\nBINDING_ADDED (0)\n_AMQ_Binding_Type, _AMQ_Address, _AMQ_ClusterName,\n_AMQ_RoutingName, _AMQ_Binding_ID, _AMQ_Distance,\n_AMQ_FilterString\n\nBINDING_REMOVED (1)\n_AMQ_Address, _AMQ_ClusterName, _AMQ_RoutingName,\n_AMQ_Binding_ID, _AMQ_Distance, _AMQ_FilterString\n\nCONSUMER_CREATED (2)\n_AMQ_Address, _AMQ_ClusterName, _AMQ_RoutingName, _AMQ_Distance,\n_AMQ_ConsumerCount, _AMQ_User, _AMQ_ValidatedUser, _AMQ_RemoteAddress,\n_AMQ_SessionName, _AMQ_FilterString, _AMQ_CertSubjectDN\n\nCONSUMER_CLOSED (3)\n_AMQ_Address, _AMQ_ClusterName, _AMQ_RoutingName, _AMQ_Distance,\n_AMQ_ConsumerCount, _AMQ_User, _AMQ_RemoteAddress,\n_AMQ_SessionName, _AMQ_FilterString\n\nSECURITY_AUTHENTICATION_VIOLATION (6)\n_AMQ_User, _AMQ_CertSubjectDN, _AMQ_RemoteAddress\n\nSECURITY_PERMISSION_VIOLATION (7)\n_AMQ_Address, _AMQ_CheckType, _AMQ_User\n\nDISCOVERY_GROUP_STARTED (8)\nname\n\nDISCOVERY_GROUP_STOPPED (9)\nname\n\nBROADCAST_GROUP_STARTED (10)\nname\n\nBROADCAST_GROUP_STOPPED (11)\nname\n\nBRIDGE_STARTED (12)\nname\n\nBRIDGE_STOPPED (13)\nname\n\nCLUSTER_CONNECTION_STARTED (14)\nname\n\nCLUSTER_CONNECTION_STOPPED (15)\nname\n\nACCEPTOR_STARTED (16)\nfactory, id\n\nACCEPTOR_STOPPED (17)\nfactory, id\n\nPROPOSAL (18)\n_JBM_ProposalGroupId, _JBM_ProposalValue, _AMQ_Binding_Type,\n_AMQ_Address, _AMQ_Distance\n\nPROPOSAL_RESPONSE (19)\n_JBM_ProposalGroupId, _JBM_ProposalValue,\n_JBM_ProposalAltValue, _AMQ_Binding_Type, _AMQ_Address,\n_AMQ_Distance\n\nCONSUMER_SLOW (21)\n_AMQ_Address, _AMQ_ConsumerCount, _AMQ_RemoteAddress,\n_AMQ_ConnectionName, _AMQ_ConsumerName, _AMQ_SessionName\n\nADDRESS_ADDED (22)\n_AMQ_Address, _AMQ_Routing_Type\n\nADDRESS_REMOVED (23)\n_AMQ_Address, _AMQ_Routing_Type\n\nCONNECTION_CREATED (24)\n_AMQ_ConnectionName, _AMQ_RemoteAddress\n\nCONNECTION_DESTROYED (25)\n_AMQ_ConnectionName, _AMQ_RemoteAddress\n\nSESSION_CREATED (26)\n_AMQ_ConnectionName, _AMQ_User, _AMQ_SessionName\n\nSESSION_CLOSED (27)\n_AMQ_ConnectionName, _AMQ_User, _AMQ_SessionName\n\nMESSAGE_DELIVERED (28)\n_AMQ_Address, _AMQ_Routing_Type, _AMQ_RoutingName,\n_AMQ_ConsumerName, _AMQ_Message_ID\n\nMESSAGE_EXPIRED (29)\n_AMQ_Address, _AMQ_Routing_Type, _AMQ_RoutingName,\n_AMQ_ConsumerName, _AMQ_Message_ID\n\n\nMessage Counters\nMessage counters can be used to obtain information on queues over time as\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis keeps a history on queue metrics.\nThey can be used to show trends on queues. For example, using the management\nAPI, it would be possible to query the number of messages in a queue at regular\ninterval. However, this would not be enough to know if the queue is used: the\nnumber of messages can remain constant because nobody is sending or receiving\nmessages from the queue or because there are as many messages sent to the queue\nthan messages consumed from it.  The number of messages in the queue remains\nthe same in both cases but its use is widely different.\nMessage counters give additional information about the queues:\n\ncount\nThe total number of messages added to the queue since the server was\nstarted\n\ncountDelta\nthe number of messages added to the queue since the last message counter\nupdate\n\nmessageCount\nThe current number of messages in the queue\n\nmessageCountDelta\nThe overall number of messages added/removed from the queue since the last\nmessage counter update. For example, if messageCountDelta is equal to -10\nthis means that overall 10 messages have been removed from the queue (e.g. 2\nmessages were added and 12 were removed)\n\nlastAddTimestamp\nThe timestamp of the last time a message was added to the queue\n\nlastAckTimestamp\nThe timestamp of the last time a message from the queue was acknowledged\n\nudpateTimestamp\nThe timestamp of the last message counter update\nThese attributes can be used to determine other meaningful data as well.  For\nexample, to know specifically how many messages were consumed from the queue\nsince the last update simply subtract the messageCountDelta from\ncountDelta.\n\n\nConfiguring Message Counters\nBy default, message counters are disabled as it might have a small negative\neffect on memory.\nTo enable message counters, you can set it to true in broker.xml:\ntrue\n\nMessage counters keep a history of the queue metrics (10 days by default) and\nsample all the queues at regular interval (10 seconds by default). If message\ncounters are enabled, these values should be configured to suit your messaging\nuse case in broker.xml:\n\n7\n\n60000\n\nMessage counters can be retrieved using the Management API. For example, to\nretrieve message counters on a queue using JMX:\n// retrieve a connection to Apache ActiveMQ Artemis's MBeanServer\nMBeanServerConnection mbsc = ...\nQueueControlMBean queueControl = (QueueControl)MBeanServerInvocationHandler.newProxyInstance(mbsc,\n   on,\n   QueueControl.class,\n   false);\n// message counters are retrieved as a JSON String\nString counters = queueControl.listMessageCounter();\n// use the MessageCounterInfo helper class to manipulate message counters more easily\nMessageCounterInfo messageCounter = MessageCounterInfo.fromJSON(counters);\nSystem.out.format(\"%s message(s) in the queue (since last sample: %s)\\n\",\nmessageCounter.getMessageCount(),\nmessageCounter.getMessageCountDelta());\n\nExample\nSee the Message Counter Example which shows how\nto use message counters to retrieve information on a queue.\n"},"management-console.html":{"url":"management-console.html","title":"Management Console","keywords":"","body":"Management Console\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis ships by default with a management console.

Entries are removed from the caches (i.e. invalidated) either\nwhen the cache reaches its maximum size in which case the least-recently used\nentry is removed or when an entry has been in the cache \"too long\".\nThe size of the caches are controlled by the authentication-cache-size and\nauthorization-cache-size configuration parameters.

The default is 10000 ms.\nTracking the Validated User\nTo assist in security auditing the populate-validated-user option exists. If\nthis is true then the server will add the name of the validated user to the\nmessage using the key _AMQ_VALIDATED_USER.  For JMS and Stomp clients this is\nmapped to the key JMSXUserID. For users authenticated based on their SSL\ncertificate this name is the name to which their certificate's DN maps. If\nsecurity-enabled is false and populate-validated-user is true then the\nserver will simply use whatever user name (if any) the client provides. This\noption is false by default.\nRole based security for addresses\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis contains a flexible role-based security model for\napplying security to queues, based on their addresses.\nAs explained in Using Core, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis core consists\nmainly of sets of queues bound to addresses. A message is sent to an address\nand the server looks up the set of queues that are bound to that address, the\nserver then routes the message to those set of queues.\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis allows sets of permissions to be defined against the\nqueues based on their address. An exact match on the address can be used or a\nwildcard match can be used.\nEight different permissions can be given to the set of queues which match the\naddress. Those permissions are:\n\ncreateAddress. This permission allows the user to create an address fitting\nthe match.\n\ndeleteAddress. This permission allows the user to delete an address fitting\nthe match.\n\ncreateDurableQueue. This permission allows the user to create a durable\nqueue under matching addresses.\n\ndeleteDurableQueue. This permission allows the user to delete a durable\nqueue under matching addresses.\n\ncreateNonDurableQueue. This permission allows the user to create a\nnon-durable queue under matching addresses.\n\ndeleteNonDurableQueue. This permission allows the user to delete a\nnon-durable queue under matching addresses.\n\nsend. This permission allows the user to send a message to matching\naddresses.\n\nconsume. This permission allows the user to consume a message from a queue\nbound to matching addresses.\n\nbrowse. This permission allows the user to browse a queue bound to the\nmatching address.\n\nmanage. This permission allows the user to invoke management operations by\nsending management messages to the management address.\n\n\nFor each permission, a list of roles who are granted that permission is\nspecified. If the user has any of those roles, he/she will be granted that\npermission for that set of addresses.\nLet's take a simple example, here's a security block from broker.xml file:\n\n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n\n\nUsing the default wildcard syntax the # character\nsignifies \"any sequence of words\". Words are delimited by the . character.\nTherefore, the above security block applies to any address that starts with the\nstring \"globalqueues.europe.\".\nOnly users who have the admin role can create or delete durable queues bound\nto an address that starts with the string \"globalqueues.europe.\"\nAny users with the roles admin, guest, or europe-users can create or\ndelete temporary queues bound to an address that starts with the string\n\"globalqueues.europe.\"\nAny users with the roles admin or europe-users can send messages to these\naddresses or consume messages from queues bound to an address that starts with\nthe string \"globalqueues.europe.\"\nThe mapping between a user and what roles they have is handled by the security\nmanager. Apache ActiveMQ Artemis ships with a user manager that reads user\ncredentials from a file on disk, and can also plug into JAAS or JBoss\nApplication Server security.\nFor more information on configuring the security manager, please see 'Changing\nthe Security Manager'.\nThere can be zero or more security-setting elements in each xml file.  Where\nmore than one match applies to a set of addresses the more specific match\ntakes precedence.\nLet's look at an example of that, here's another security-setting block:\n\n   \n   \n\n\nIn this security-setting block the match 'globalqueues.europe.orders.#' is\nmore specific than the previous match 'globalqueues.europe.#'. So any\naddresses which match 'globalqueues.europe.orders.#' will take their security\nsettings only from the latter security-setting block.\nNote that settings are not inherited from the former block. All the settings\nwill be taken from the more specific matching block, so for the address\n'globalqueues.europe.orders.plastics' the only permissions that exist are\nsend and consume for the role europe-users. The permissions\ncreateDurableQueue, deleteDurableQueue, createNonDurableQueue,\ndeleteNonDurableQueue are not inherited from the other security-setting\nblock.\nBy not inheriting permissions, it allows you to effectively deny permissions in\nmore specific security-setting blocks by simply not specifying them. Otherwise\nit would not be possible to deny permissions in sub-groups of addresses.\nFine-grained security using fully qualified queue name\nIn certain situations it may be necessary to configure security that is more\nfine-grained that simply across an entire address. For example, consider an\naddress with multiple queues:\n\n   \n      \n         \n         \n      \n   \n\n\nYou may want to limit consumption from q1 to one role and consumption from\nq2 to another role. You can do this using the fully qualified queue name (i.e.\nfqqn\") in the match of the security-setting, e.g.:\n\n   \n\n\n   \n\n\nSecurity Setting Plugin\nAside from configuring sets of permissions via XML these permissions can\nalternatively be configured via a plugin which implements\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.core.server.SecuritySettingPlugin e.g.:\n\n   \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n   \n\n\nMost of this configuration is specific to the plugin implementation. However,\nthere are two configuration details that will be specified for every\nimplementation:\n\nclass-name. This attribute of security-setting-plugin indicates the name\nof the class which implements\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.core.server.SecuritySettingPlugin.\n\nsetting. Each of these elements represents a name/value pair that will be\npassed to the implementation for configuration purposes.\n\n\nSee the JavaDoc on\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.core.server.SecuritySettingPlugin for further\ndetails about the interface and what each method is expected to do.\nAvailable plugins\nLegacyLDAPSecuritySettingPlugin\nThis plugin will read the security information that was previously handled by\nLDAPAuthorizationMap and the\ncachedLDAPAuthorizationMap\nin Apache ActiveMQ 5.x and turn it into Artemis security settings where\npossible. The security implementations of ActiveMQ 5.x and Artemis don't match\nperfectly so some translation must occur to achieve near equivalent\nfunctionality.\nHere is an example of the plugin's configuration:\n\n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n\n\n\nclass-name. The implementation is\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.core.server.impl.LegacyLDAPSecuritySettingPlugin.\n\ninitialContextFactory. The initial context factory used to connect to LDAP.\nIt must always be set to com.sun.jndi.ldap.LdapCtxFactory (i.e. the default\nvalue).\n\nconnectionURL. Specifies the location of the directory server using an ldap\nURL, ldap://Host:Port. You can optionally qualify this URL, by adding a\nforward slash, /, followed by the DN of a particular node in the directory\ntree. For example, ldap://ldapserver:10389/ou=system. The default is\nldap://localhost:1024.\n\nconnectionUsername. The DN of the user that opens the connection to the\ndirectory server. For example, uid=admin,ou=system.  Directory servers\ngenerally require clients to present username/password credentials in order to\nopen a connection.\n\nconnectionPassword. The password that matches the DN from\nconnectionUsername. In the directory server, in the DIT, the password is\nnormally stored as a userPassword attribute in the corresponding directory\nentry.\n\nconnectionProtocol. Currently the only supported value is a blank string.\nIn future, this option will allow you to select the Secure Socket Layer (SSL)\nfor the connection to the directory server. Note: this option must be set\nexplicitly to an empty string, because it has no default value.\n\nauthentication. Specifies the authentication method used when binding to\nthe LDAP server. Can take either of the values, simple (username and\npassword, the default value) or none (anonymous). Note: Simple Authentication\nand Security Layer (SASL) authentication is currently not supported.\n\ndestinationBase. Specifies the DN of the node whose children provide the\npermissions for all destinations. In this case the DN is a literal value\n(that is, no string substitution is performed on the property value).  For\nexample, a typical value of this property is\nou=destinations,o=ActiveMQ,ou=system (i.e. the default value).\n\nfilter. Specifies an LDAP search filter, which is used when looking up the\npermissions for any kind of destination.  The search filter attempts to match\none of the children or descendants of the queue or topic node. The default\nvalue is (cn=*).\n\nroleAttribute. Specifies an attribute of the node matched by filter,\nwhose value is the DN of a role. Default value is uniqueMember.\n\nadminPermissionValue. Specifies a value that matches the admin\npermission. The default value is admin.\n\nreadPermissionValue. Specifies a value that matches the read permission.\nThe default value is read.\n\nwritePermissionValue. Specifies a value that matches the write\npermission. The default value is write.\n\nenableListener. Whether or not to enable a listener that will automatically\nreceive updates made in the LDAP server and update the broker's authorization\nconfiguration in real-time. The default value is true.\n\nmapAdminToManage. Whether or not to map the legacy admin permission to the\nmanage permission. See details of the mapping semantics below. The default\n value is false.\n\nallowQueueAdminOnRead. Whether or not to map the legacy read permission to\nthe createDurableQueue, createNonDurableQueue, and deleteDurableQueue\npermissions so that JMS clients can create durable and non-durable subscriptions\nwithout needing the admin permission. This was allowed in ActiveMQ 5.x. The\ndefault value is false.\n\n\nThe name of the queue or topic defined in LDAP will serve as the \"match\" for\nthe security-setting, the permission value will be mapped from the ActiveMQ 5.x\ntype to the Artemis type, and the role will be mapped as-is.\nActiveMQ 5.x only has 3 permission types - read, write, and admin. These\npermission types are described on their\nwebsite. However, as described\npreviously, ActiveMQ Artemis has 9 permission types - createAddress,\ndeleteAddress, createDurableQueue, deleteDurableQueue,\ncreateNonDurableQueue, deleteNonDurableQueue, send, consume, browse,\nand manage. Here's how the old types are mapped to the new types:\n\nread - consume, browse\nwrite - send\nadmin - createAddress, deleteAddress, createDurableQueue,\ndeleteDurableQueue, createNonDurableQueue, deleteNonDurableQueue,\nmanage (if mapAdminToManage is true)\n\nAs mentioned, there are a few places where a translation was performed to\nachieve some equivalence.:\n\nThis mapping doesn't include the Artemis manage permission type by default\nsince there is no type analogous for that in ActiveMQ 5.x. However, if\nmapAdminToManage is true then the legacy admin permission will be\nmapped to the manage permission.\n\nThe admin permission in ActiveMQ 5.x relates to whether or not the broker\nwill auto-create a destination if it doesn't exist and the user sends a\nmessage to it. Artemis automatically allows the automatic creation of a\ndestination if the user has permission to send message to it. Therefore, the\nplugin will map the admin permission to the 6 aforementioned permissions in\nArtemis by default. If mapAdminToManage is true then the legacy admin\npermission will be mapped to the manage permission as well.\n\n\nSecure Sockets Layer (SSL) Transport\nWhen messaging clients are connected to servers, or servers are connected to\nother servers (e.g. via bridges) over an untrusted network then Apache ActiveMQ\nArtemis allows that traffic to be encrypted using the Secure Sockets Layer\n(SSL) transport.\nFor more information on configuring the SSL transport, please see Configuring\nthe Transport.\nUser credentials\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis ships with three security manager implementations:\n\nThe flexible, pluggable ActiveMQJAASSecurityManager which supports any\nstandard JAAS login module. Artemis ships with several login modules which\nwill be discussed further down. This is the default security manager.\n\nThe ActiveMQBasicSecurityManager which doesn't use JAAS and only supports\nauth via username & password credentials. It also supports adding, removing,\nand updating users via the management API. All user & role data is stored\nin the broker's bindings journal which means any changes made to a live\nbroker will be available on its backup.\n\nThe legacy, deprecated ActiveMQSecurityManagerImpl that reads user\ncredentials, i.e. user names, passwords and role information from properties\nfiles on the classpath called artemis-users.properties and\nartemis-roles.properties.\n\n\nJAAS Security Manager\nWhen using the Java Authentication and Authorization Service (JAAS) much of the\nconfiguration depends on which login module is used. However, there are a few\ncommonalities for every case.  The first place to look is in bootstrap.xml.\nHere is an example using the PropertiesLogin JAAS login module which reads\nuser, password, and role information from properties files:\n\n\nNo matter what login module you're using, you'll need to specify it here in\nbootstrap.xml. The domain attribute here refers to the relevant login\nmodule entry in login.config. For example:\nPropertiesLogin {\n    org.apache.activemq.artemis.spi.core.security.jaas.PropertiesLoginModule required\n        debug=true\n        org.apache.activemq.jaas.properties.user=\"artemis-users.properties\"\n        org.apache.activemq.jaas.properties.role=\"artemis-roles.properties\";\n};\nThe login.config file is a standard JAAS configuration file. You can read\nmore about this file on Oracle's\nwebsite.\nIn short, the file defines:\n\nan alias for an entry (e.g. PropertiesLogin)\n\nthe implementation class for the login module (e.g.\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.spi.core.security.jaas.PropertiesLoginModule)\n\na flag which indicates whether the success of the login module is required,\nrequisite, sufficient, or optional (see more details on these flags in\nthe\nJavaDoc\n\na list of configuration options specific to the login module implementation\n\n\nBy default, the location and name of login.config is specified on the Artemis\ncommand-line which is set by etc/artemis.profile on linux and \netc\\artemis.profile.cmd on Windows.\nDual Authentication\nThe JAAS Security Manager also supports another configuration parameter -\ncertificate-domain. This is useful when you want to authenticate clients\nconnecting with SSL connections based on their SSL certificates (e.g. using the\nCertificateLoginModule discussed below) but you still want to authenticate\nclients connecting with non-SSL connections with, e.g., username and password.\nHere's an example of what would go in bootstrap.xml:\n\n\nAnd here's the corresponding login.config:\nPropertiesLogin {\n   org.apache.activemq.artemis.spi.core.security.jaas.PropertiesLoginModule required\n       debug=false\n       org.apache.activemq.jaas.properties.user=\"artemis-users.properties\"\n       org.apache.activemq.jaas.properties.role=\"artemis-roles.properties\";\n};\n\nCertLogin {\n   org.apache.activemq.artemis.spi.core.security.jaas.TextFileCertificateLoginModule required\n       debug=true\n       org.apache.activemq.jaas.textfiledn.user=\"cert-users.properties\"\n       org.apache.activemq.jaas.textfiledn.role=\"cert-roles.properties\";\n};\nWhen the broker is configured this way then any client connecting with SSL and\na client certificate will be authenticated using CertLogin and any client\nconnecting without SSL will be authenticated using PropertiesLogin.\nJAAS Login Modules\nGuestLoginModule\nAllows users without credentials (and, depending on how it is configured,\npossibly also users with invalid credentials) to access the broker. Normally,\nthe guest login module is chained with another login module, such as a\nproperties login module. It is implemented by\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.spi.core.security.jaas.GuestLoginModule.\n\norg.apache.activemq.jaas.guest.user - the user name to assign; default is \"guest\"\n\norg.apache.activemq.jaas.guest.role - the role name to assign; default is \"guests\"\n\ncredentialsInvalidate - boolean flag; if true, reject login requests that\ninclude a password (i.e. guest login succeeds only when the user does not\nprovide a password); default is false\n\ndebug - boolean flag; if true, enable debugging; this is used only for\ntesting or debugging; normally, it should be set to false, or omitted;\ndefault is false\n\n\nThere are two basic use cases for the guest login module, as follows:\n\nGuests with no credentials or invalid credentials.\n\nGuests with no credentials only.\n\n\nThe following snippet shows how to configure a JAAS login entry for the use\ncase where users with no credentials or invalid credentials are logged in as\nguests. In this example, the guest login module is used in combination with the\nproperties login module.\nactivemq-domain {\n  org.apache.activemq.artemis.spi.core.security.jaas.PropertiesLoginModule sufficient\n      debug=true\n      org.apache.activemq.jaas.properties.user=\"artemis-users.properties\"\n      org.apache.activemq.jaas.properties.role=\"artemis-roles.properties\";\n\n  org.apache.activemq.artemis.spi.core.security.jaas.GuestLoginModule sufficient\n      debug=true\n      org.apache.activemq.jaas.guest.user=\"anyone\"\n      org.apache.activemq.jaas.guest.role=\"restricted\";\n};\nDepending on the user login data, authentication proceeds as follows:\n\nUser logs in with a valid password — the properties login module successfully\nauthenticates the user and returns immediately. The guest login module is not\ninvoked.\n\nUser logs in with an invalid password — the properties login module fails to\nauthenticate the user, and authentication proceeds to the guest login module.\nThe guest login module successfully authenticates the user and returns the\nguest principal.\n\nUser logs in with a blank password — the properties login module fails to\nauthenticate the user, and authentication proceeds to the guest login module.\nThe guest login module successfully authenticates the user and returns the\nguest principal.\n\n\nThe following snipped shows how to configure a JAAS login entry for the use\ncase where only those users with no credentials are logged in as guests. To\nsupport this use case, you must set the credentialsInvalidate option to true in\nthe configuration of the guest login module. You should also note that,\ncompared with the preceding example, the order of the login modules is reversed\nand the flag attached to the properties login module is changed to requisite.\nactivemq-guest-when-no-creds-only-domain {\n    org.apache.activemq.artemis.spi.core.security.jaas.GuestLoginModule sufficient\n        debug=true\n       credentialsInvalidate=true\n       org.apache.activemq.jaas.guest.user=\"guest\"\n       org.apache.activemq.jaas.guest.role=\"guests\";\n\n    org.apache.activemq.artemis.spi.core.security.jaas.PropertiesLoginModule requisite\n        debug=true\n        org.apache.activemq.jaas.properties.user=\"artemis-users.properties\"\n        org.apache.activemq.jaas.properties.role=\"artemis-roles.properties\";\n};\nDepending on the user login data, authentication proceeds as follows:\n\nUser logs in with a valid password — the guest login module fails to\nauthenticate the user (because the user has presented a password while the\ncredentialsInvalidate option is enabled) and authentication proceeds to the\nproperties login module. The properties login module successfully authenticates\nthe user and returns.\n\nUser logs in with an invalid password — the guest login module fails to\nauthenticate the user and authentication proceeds to the properties login\nmodule. The properties login module also fails to authenticate the user. The\nnet result is authentication failure.\n\nUser logs in with a blank password — the guest login module successfully\nauthenticates the user and returns immediately.  The properties login module\nis not invoked.\n\n\nPropertiesLoginModule\nThe JAAS properties login module provides a simple store of authentication\ndata, where the relevant user data is stored in a pair of flat files. This is\nconvenient for demonstrations and testing, but for an enterprise system, the\nintegration with LDAP is preferable. It is implemented by\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.spi.core.security.jaas.PropertiesLoginModule.\n\norg.apache.activemq.jaas.properties.user - the path to the file which\ncontains user and password properties\n\norg.apache.activemq.jaas.properties.role - the path to the file which\ncontains user and role properties\n\nreload - boolean flag; whether or not to reload the properties files when a\nmodification occurs; default is false\n\ndebug - boolean flag; if true, enable debugging; this is used only for\ntesting or debugging; normally, it should be set to false, or omitted;\ndefault is false\n\n\nIn the context of the properties login module, the artemis-users.properties\nfile consists of a list of properties of the form, UserName=Password. For\nexample, to define the users system, user, and guest, you could create a\nfile like the following:\nsystem=manager\nuser=password\nguest=password\n\nPasswords in artemis-users.properties can be hashed. Such passwords should\nfollow the syntax ENC(). Hashed passwords can easily be added to\nartemis-users.properties using the user CLI command from the Artemis\ninstance. This command will not work from the Artemis home.\n./artemis user add --user guest --password guest --role admin\n\nThis will use the default codec to perform a \"one-way\" hash of the password\nand alter both the artemis-users.properties and artemis-roles.properties\nfiles with the specified values.\nThe artemis-roles.properties file consists of a list of properties of the\nform, Role=UserList, where UserList is a comma-separated list of users. For\nexample, to define the roles admins, users, and guests, you could create\na file like the following:\nadmins=system\nusers=system,user\nguests=guest\n\nAs mentioned above, the Artemis command-line interface supports a command to\nadd a user. Commands to list (one or all) users, remove a user, and reset\na user's password and/or role(s) are also supported via the command-line\ninterface as well as the normal management interfaces (e.g. JMX, web console,\netc.).\n\nWarning\nManagement and CLI operations to manipulate user & role data are only available\nwhen using the PropertiesLoginModule.\n\nLDAPLoginModule\nThe LDAP login module enables you to perform authentication and authorization\nby checking the incoming credentials against user data stored in a central\nX.500 directory server. For systems that already have an X.500 directory server\nin place, this means that you can rapidly integrate ActiveMQ Artemis with the\nexisting security database and user accounts can be managed using the X.500\nsystem. It is implemented by\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.spi.core.security.jaas.LDAPLoginModule.\n\ninitialContextFactory - must always be set to\ncom.sun.jndi.ldap.LdapCtxFactory\n\nconnectionURL - specify the location of the directory server using an ldap\nURL, ldap://Host:Port. You can optionally qualify this URL, by adding a\nforward slash, /, followed by the DN of a particular node in the directory\ntree. For example, ldap://ldapserver:10389/ou=system.\n\nauthentication - specifies the authentication method used when binding to\nthe LDAP server. Can take either of the values, simple (username and\npassword), GSSAPI (Kerberos SASL) or none (anonymous).\n\nconnectionUsername - the DN of the user that opens the connection to the\ndirectory server. For example, uid=admin,ou=system. Directory servers\ngenerally require clients to present username/password credentials in order to\nopen a connection.\n\nconnectionPassword - the password that matches the DN from\nconnectionUsername. In the directory server, in the DIT, the password is\nnormally stored as a userPassword attribute in the corresponding directory\nentry.\n\nsaslLoginConfigScope - the scope in JAAS configuration (login.config) to\nuse to obtain Kerberos initiator credentials when the authentication method\nis SASL GSSAPI. The default value is broker-sasl-gssapi.\n\nconnectionProtocol - currently, the only supported value is a blank string.\nIn future, this option will allow you to select the Secure Socket Layer (SSL)\nfor the connection to the directory server. This option must be set explicitly\nto an empty string, because it has no default value.\n\nconnectionPool - boolean, enable the LDAP connection pool property\n'com.sun.jndi.ldap.connect.pool'. Note that the pool is\nconfigured at the jvm level with system properties.\n\nconnectionTimeout - specifies the string representation of an integer\nrepresenting the connection timeout in milliseconds. If the LDAP provider\ncannot establish a connection within that period, it aborts the connection\nattempt. The integer should be greater than zero. An integer less than or\nequal to zero means to use the network protocol's (i.e., TCP's) timeout\nvalue.\nIf connectionTimeout is not specified, the default is to wait for the\nconnection to be established or until the underlying network times out.\nWhen connection pooling has been requested for a connection, this property\nalso determines the maximum wait time for a connection when all connections\nin the pool are in use and the maximum pool size has been reached. If the\nvalue of this property is less than or equal to zero under such\ncircumstances, the provider will wait indefinitely for a connection to\nbecome available; otherwise, the provider will abort the wait when the\nmaximum wait time has been exceeded. See connectionPool for more details.\n\nreadTimeout - specifies the string representation of an integer representing\nthe read timeout in milliseconds for LDAP operations. If the LDAP provider\ncannot get a LDAP response within that period, it aborts the read attempt.\nThe integer should be greater than zero. An integer less than or equal to\nzero means no read timeout is specified which is equivalent to waiting for\nthe response infinitely until it is received.\nIf readTimeout is not specified, the default is to wait for the response\nuntil it is received.\n\nuserBase - selects a particular subtree of the DIT to search for user\nentries. The subtree is specified by a DN, which specifes the base node of\nthe subtree. For example, by setting this option to\nou=User,ou=ActiveMQ,ou=system, the search for user entries is restricted to\nthe subtree beneath the ou=User,ou=ActiveMQ,ou=system node.\n\nuserSearchMatching - specifies an LDAP search filter, which is applied to\nthe subtree selected by userBase.  Before passing to the LDAP search\noperation, the string value you provide here is subjected to string\nsubstitution, as implemented by the java.text.MessageFormat class.\nEssentially, this means that the special string, {0}, is substituted by the\nusername, as extracted from the incoming client credentials.\nAfter substitution, the string is interpreted as an LDAP search filter,\nwhere the LDAP search filter syntax is defined by the IETF standard, RFC 2254.\nA short introduction to the search filter syntax is available from Oracle's\nJNDI tutorial, Search\nFilters.\nFor example, if this option is set to (uid={0}) and the received username\nis jdoe, the search filter becomes (uid=jdoe) after string substitution. If\nthe resulting search filter is applied to the subtree selected by the user\nbase, ou=User,ou=ActiveMQ,ou=system, it would match the entry,\nuid=jdoe,ou=User,ou=ActiveMQ,ou=system (and possibly more deeply nested\nentries, depending on the specified search depth—see the userSearchSubtree\noption).\n\nuserSearchSubtree - specify the search depth for user entries, relative to\nthe node specified by userBase.  This option is a boolean. false\nindicates it will try to match one of the child entries of the userBase node\n(maps to javax.naming.directory.SearchControls.ONELEVEL_SCOPE). true\n  indicates it will try to match any entry belonging to the subtree of the\nuserBase node (maps to\njavax.naming.directory.SearchControls.SUBTREE_SCOPE).\n\nuserRoleName - specifies the name of the multi-valued attribute of the user\nentry that contains a list of role names for the user (where the role names\nare interpreted as group names by the broker's authorization plug-in).  If you\nomit this option, no role names are extracted from the user entry.\n\nroleBase - if you want to store role data directly in the directory server,\nyou can use a combination of role options (roleBase, roleSearchMatching,\nroleSearchSubtree, and roleName) as an alternative to (or in addition to)\nspecifying the userRoleName option. This option selects a particular subtree\nof the DIT to search for role/group entries. The subtree is specified by a DN,\nwhich specifes the base node of the subtree. For example, by setting this\noption to ou=Group,ou=ActiveMQ,ou=system, the search for role/group entries\nis restricted to the subtree beneath the ou=Group,ou=ActiveMQ,ou=system node.\n\nroleName - specifies the attribute type of the role entry that contains the\nname of the role/group (e.g. C, O, OU, etc.). If you omit this option the\nfull DN of the role is used.\n\nroleSearchMatching - specifies an LDAP search filter, which is applied to\nthe subtree selected by roleBase.  This works in a similar manner to the\nuserSearchMatching option, except that it supports two substitution strings,\nas follows:\n\n{0} - substitutes the full DN of the matched user entry (that is, the\nresult of the user search). For example, for the user, jdoe, the\nsubstituted string could be uid=jdoe,ou=User,ou=ActiveMQ,ou=system.\n\n{1} - substitutes the received username. For example, jdoe.\nFor example, if this option is set to (member=uid={1}) and the received\nusername is jdoe, the search filter becomes (member=uid=jdoe) after string\nsubstitution (assuming ApacheDS search filter syntax). If the resulting search\nfilter is applied to the subtree selected by the role base,\nou=Group,ou=ActiveMQ,ou=system, it matches all role entries that have a\nmember attribute equal to uid=jdoe (the value of a member attribute is a\nDN).\nThis option must always be set to enable role searching because it has no\ndefault value. Leaving it unset disables role searching and the role\ninformation must come from userRoleName.\nIf you use OpenLDAP, the syntax of the search filter is\n(member:=uid=jdoe).\n\n\n\nroleSearchSubtree - specify the search depth for role entries, relative to\nthe node specified by roleBase.  This option can take boolean values, as\nfollows:\n\nfalse (default) - try to match one of the child entries of the roleBase\nnode (maps to javax.naming.directory.SearchControls.ONELEVEL_SCOPE).\n\ntrue — try to match any entry belonging to the subtree of the roleBase\nnode (maps to javax.naming.directory.SearchControls.SUBTREE_SCOPE).\n\n\n\nauthenticateUser - boolean flag to disable authentication. Useful as an\noptimisation when this module is used just for role mapping of a Subject's\nexisting authenticated principals; default is true.\n\nreferral - specify how to handle referrals; valid values: ignore,\nfollow, throw; default is ignore.\n\nignorePartialResultException - boolean flag for use when searching Active\nDirectory (AD). AD servers don't handle referrals automatically, which causes \na PartialResultException to be thrown when referrals are encountered by a \nsearch, even if referral is set to ignore. Set to true to ignore these \nexceptions; default is false.\n\nexpandRoles - boolean indicating whether to enable the role expansion\nfunctionality or not; default false. If enabled, then roles within roles will\nbe found. For example, role A is in role B. User X is in role A,\nwhich means user X is in role B by virtue of being in role A.\n\nexpandRolesMatching - specifies an LDAP search filter which is applied to\nthe subtree selected by roleBase. Before passing to the LDAP search operation,\nthe string value you provide here is subjected to string substitution, as\nimplemented by the java.text.MessageFormat class. Essentially, this means that\nthe special string, {0}, is substituted by the role name as extracted from the\nprevious role search. This option must always be set to enable role expansion\nbecause it has no default value. Example value: (member={0}).\n\ndebug - boolean flag; if true, enable debugging; this is used only for\ntesting or debugging; normally, it should be set to false, or omitted;\ndefault is false\n\n\nAdd user entries under the node specified by the userBase option. When\ncreating a new user entry in the directory, choose an object class that\nsupports the userPassword attribute (for example, the person or\ninetOrgPerson object classes are typically suitable). After creating the user\nentry, add the userPassword attribute, to hold the user's password.\nIf you want to store role data in dedicated role entries (where each node\nrepresents a particular role), create a role entry as follows. Create a new\nchild of the roleBase node, where the objectClass of the child is\ngroupOfNames. Set the cn (or whatever attribute type is specified by\nroleName) of the new child node equal to the name of the role/group. Define a\nmember attribute for each member of the role/group, setting the member\nvalue to the DN of the corresponding user (where the DN is specified either\nfully, uid=jdoe,ou=User,ou=ActiveMQ,ou=system, or partially, uid=jdoe).\nIf you want to add roles to user entries, you would need to customize the\ndirectory schema, by adding a suitable attribute type to the user entry's\nobject class. The chosen attribute type must be capable of handling multiple\nvalues.\nCertificateLoginModule\nThe JAAS certificate authentication login module must be used in combination\nwith SSL and the clients must be configured with their own certificate. In this\nscenario, authentication is actually performed during the SSL/TLS handshake,\nnot directly by the JAAS certificate authentication plug-in. The role of the\nplug-in is as follows:\n\nTo further constrain the set of acceptable users, because only the user DNs\nexplicitly listed in the relevant properties file are eligible to be\nauthenticated.\n\nTo associate a list of groups with the received user identity, facilitating\nintegration with the authorization feature.\n\nTo require the presence of an incoming certificate (by default, the SSL/TLS\nlayer is configured to treat the presence of a client certificate as\noptional).\n\n\nThe JAAS certificate login module stores a collection of certificate DNs in a\npair of flat files. The files associate a username and a list of group IDs with\neach DN.\nThe certificate login module is implemented by the following class:\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.spi.core.security.jaas.TextFileCertificateLoginModule\n\nThe following CertLogin login entry shows how to configure certificate login\nmodule in the login.config file:\nCertLogin {\n    org.apache.activemq.artemis.spi.core.security.jaas.TextFileCertificateLoginModule\n        debug=true\n        org.apache.activemq.jaas.textfiledn.user=\"users.properties\"\n        org.apache.activemq.jaas.textfiledn.role=\"roles.properties\";\n};\nIn the preceding example, the JAAS realm is configured to use a single\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.spi.core.security.jaas.TextFileCertificateLoginModule\nlogin module. The options supported by this login module are as follows:\n\ndebug - boolean flag; if true, enable debugging; this is used only for testing or debugging; normally,\nit should be set to false, or omitted; default is false\n\norg.apache.activemq.jaas.textfiledn.user - specifies the location of the user properties file (relative to the\n directory containing the login configuration file).\n\norg.apache.activemq.jaas.textfiledn.role - specifies the location of the role properties file (relative to the\ndirectory containing the login configuration file).\n\nreload - boolean flag; whether or not to reload the properties files when a modification occurs; default is false\n\n\nIn the context of the certificate login module, the users.properties file consists of a list of properties of the form,\nUserName=StringifiedSubjectDN or UserName=/SubjectDNRegExp/. For example, to define the users, system, user and\nguest as well as a hosts user matching several DNs, you could create a file like the following:\nsystem=CN=system,O=Progress,C=US\nuser=CN=humble user,O=Progress,C=US\nguest=CN=anon,O=Progress,C=DE\nhosts=/CN=host\\\\d+\\\\.acme\\\\.com,O=Acme,C=UK/\nNote that the backslash character has to be escaped because it has a special treatment in properties files.\nEach username is mapped to a subject DN, encoded as a string (where the string encoding is specified by RFC 2253). For\nexample, the system username is mapped to the CN=system,O=Progress,C=US subject DN. When performing authentication,\nthe plug-in extracts the subject DN from the received certificate, converts it to the standard string format, and\ncompares it with the subject DNs in the users.properties file by testing for string equality. Consequently, you must\nbe careful to ensure that the subject DNs appearing in the users.properties file are an exact match for the subject\nDNs extracted from the user certificates.\n\norg.apache.activemq.jaas.textfiledn.user - specifies the location of the\nuser properties file (relative to the directory containing the login\nconfiguration file).\n\norg.apache.activemq.jaas.textfiledn.role - specifies the location of the\nrole properties file (relative to the directory containing the login\nconfiguration file).\n\nreload - boolean flag; whether or not to reload the properties files when a\nmodification occurs; default is false\n\n\nIn the context of the certificate login module, the users.properties file\nconsists of a list of properties of the form, UserName=StringifiedSubjectDN.\nFor example, to define the users, system, user, and guest, you could create a\nfile like the following:\nsystem=CN=system,O=Progress,C=US\nuser=CN=humble user,O=Progress,C=US\nguest=CN=anon,O=Progress,C=DE\n\nEach username is mapped to a subject DN, encoded as a string (where the string\nencoding is specified by RFC 2253). For example, the system username is mapped\nto the CN=system,O=Progress,C=US subject DN. When performing authentication,\nthe plug-in extracts the subject DN from the received certificate, converts it\nto the standard string format, and compares it with the subject DNs in the\nusers.properties file by testing for string equality. Consequently, you must\nbe careful to ensure that the subject DNs appearing in the users.properties\nfile are an exact match for the subject DNs extracted from the user\ncertificates.\nNote: Technically, there is some residual ambiguity in the DN string format.\nFor example, the domainComponent attribute could be represented in a string\neither as the string, DC, or as the OID, 0.9.2342.19200300.100.1.25.\nNormally, you do not need to worry about this ambiguity. But it could\npotentially be a problem, if you changed the underlying implementation of the\nJava security layer.\nThe easiest way to obtain the subject DNs from the user certificates is by\ninvoking the keytool utility to print the certificate contents. To print the\ncontents of a certificate in a keystore, perform the following steps:\n\nExport the certificate from the keystore file into a temporary file. For\nexample, to export the certificate with alias broker-localhost from the\nbroker.ks keystore file, enter the following command:\nkeytool -export -file broker.export -alias broker-localhost -keystore broker.ks -storepass password\n\nAfter running this command, the exported certificate is in the file,\nbroker.export.\n\nPrint out the contents of the exported certificate. For example, to print\nout the contents of broker.export, enter the following command:\nkeytool -printcert -file broker.export\n\nWhich should produce output similar to that shown here:\nOwner: CN=localhost, OU=broker, O=Unknown, L=Unknown, ST=Unknown, C=Unknown\nIssuer: CN=localhost, OU=broker, O=Unknown, L=Unknown, ST=Unknown, C=Unknown\nSerial number: 4537c82e\nValid from: Thu Oct 19 19:47:10 BST 2006 until: Wed Jan 17 18:47:10 GMT 2007\nCertificate fingerprints:\n         MD5:  3F:6C:0C:89:A8:80:29:CC:F5:2D:DA:5C:D7:3F:AB:37\n         SHA1: F0:79:0D:04:38:5A:46:CE:86:E1:8A:20:1F:7B:AB:3A:46:E4:34:5C\nThe string following Owner: gives the subject DN. The format used to enter\nthe subject DN depends on your platform. The Owner: string above could be\nrepresented as either CN=localhost,\\ OU=broker,\\ O=Unknown,\\ L=Unknown,\\\nST=Unknown,\\ C=Unknown or\nCN=localhost,OU=broker,O=Unknown,L=Unknown,ST=Unknown,C=Unknown.\n\n\nThe roles.properties file consists of a list of properties of the form,\nRole=UserList, where UserList is a comma-separated list of users. For\nexample, to define the roles admins, users, and guests, you could create\na file like the following:\nadmins=system\nusers=system,user\nguests=guest\n\nKrb5LoginModule\nThe Kerberos login module is used to propagate a validated SASL GSSAPI kerberos token\nidentity into a validated JAAS UserPrincipal. This allows subsequent login modules to\ndo role mapping for the kerberos identity.\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.spi.core.security.jaas.Krb5LoginModule required\n    ;\nExternalCertificateLoginModule\nThe external certificate login module is used to propagate a validated TLS client\ncertificate's subjectDN into a JAAS UserPrincipal. This allows subsequent login modules to\ndo role mapping for the TLS client certificate.\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.spi.core.security.jaas.ExternalCertificateLoginModule required\n    ;\nThe simplest way to make the login configuration available to JAAS is to add\nthe directory containing the file, login.config, to your CLASSPATH.\nKerberos Authentication\nYou must have the Kerberos infrastructure set up in your deployment environment\nbefore the server can accept Kerberos credentials.  The server can acquire its\nKerberos acceptor credentials by using JAAS and a Kerberos login module. The\nJDK provides the\nKrb5LoginModule\nwhich executes the necessary Kerberos protocol steps to authenticate and obtain\nKerberos credentials.\nGSSAPI SASL Mechanism\nUsing SASL over AMQP, Kerberos authentication is supported\nusing the GSSAPI SASL mechanism.  With SASL doing Kerberos authentication,\nTLS can be used to provide integrity and confidentially to the communications\nchannel in the normal way.\nThe GSSAPI SASL mechanism must be enabled  on the AMQP acceptor in\nbroker.xml by adding it to the saslMechanisms list url parameter:\nsaslMechanisms=\"GSSAPI.\ntcp://0.0.0.0:5672?protocols=AMQP;saslMechanisms=GSSAPI\n\nThe GSSAPI mechanism implementation on the server will use a JAAS configuration\nscope named amqp-sasl-gssapi to obtain its Kerberos acceptor credentials. An\nalternative configuration scope can be specified on the AMQP acceptor using the\nurl parameter: saslLoginConfigScope=.\nAn example configuration scope for login.config that will pick up a Kerberos\nkeyTab for the Kerberos acceptor Principal amqp/localhost is as follows:\namqp-sasl-gssapi {\n    com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule required\n    isInitiator=false\n    storeKey=true\n    useKeyTab=true\n    principal=\"amqp/localhost\"\n    debug=true;\n};\nRole Mapping\nOn the server, the Kerberos authenticated Peer Principal can be added to the\nSubject's principal set as an Apache ActiveMQ Artemis UserPrincipal using the\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis Krb5LoginModule login module. The\nPropertiesLoginModule or\nLDAPLoginModule can then be used to map the authenticated\nKerberos Peer Principal to an Apache ActiveMQ Artemis\nRole. Note that the Kerberos Peer\nPrincipal does not exist as an Apache ActiveMQ Artemis user, only as a role\nmember.\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.spi.core.security.jaas.Krb5LoginModule required\n    ;\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.spi.core.security.jaas.LDAPLoginModule optional\n    initialContextFactory=com.sun.jndi.ldap.LdapCtxFactory\n    connectionURL=\"ldap://localhost:1024\"\n    authentication=GSSAPI\n    saslLoginConfigScope=broker-sasl-gssapi\n    connectionProtocol=s\n    userBase=\"ou=users,dc=example,dc=com\"\n    userSearchMatching=\"(krb5PrincipalName={0})\"\n    userSearchSubtree=true\n    authenticateUser=false\n    roleBase=\"ou=system\"\n    roleName=cn\n    roleSearchMatching=\"(member={0})\"\n    roleSearchSubtree=false\n    ;\nTLS Kerberos Cipher Suites\nThe legacy rfc2712 defines TLS Kerberos\ncipher suites that can be used by TLS to negotiate Kerberos authentication. The\ncypher suites offered by rfc2712 are dated and insecure and rfc2712 has been\nsuperseded by SASL GSSAPI. However, for clients that don't support SASL (core\nclient), using TLS can provide Kerberos authentication over an unsecure\nchannel.\nBasic Security Manager\nAs the name suggests, the ActiveMQBasicSecurityManager is basic. It is not\npluggable like the JAAS security manager and it only supports authentication\nvia username and password credentials. Furthermore, the the Hawtio-based web\nconsole requires JAAS. Therefore you will still need to configure a\nlogin.config if you plan on using the web console. However, this security\nmanager may still may have a couple of advantages depending on your use-case.\nAll user & role data is stored in the bindings journal (or bindings table if\nusing JDBC). The advantage here is that in a live/backup use-case any user\nmanagement performed on the live broker will be reflected on the backup upon\nfailover. Typically LDAP would be employed for this kind of use-case, but not\neveryone wants or is able to administer an independent LDAP server.\nUser management is provided by the broker's management API. This includes the\nability to add, list, update, and remove users & roles. As with all management\nfunctions, this is available via JMX, management messages, HTTP (via Jolokia),\nweb console, etc. These functions are also available from the ActiveMQ Artemis\ncommand-line interface. Having the broker store this data directly means that\nit must be running in order to manage users. There is no way to modify the\nbindings data manually.\nTo be clear, any management access via HTTP (e.g. web console or Jolokia) will\ngo through Hawtio JAAS. MBean access via JConsole or other remote JMX tool will\ngo through the basic security manager. Management messages will also go through\nthe basic security manager.\nConfiguration\nThe configuration for the ActiveMQBasicSecurityManager happens in\nbootstrap.xml just like it does for all security manager implementations.\nHere's an example:\n\n\n   \n      \n      \n      \n   \n\n   ...\n\n\nBecause the bindings data which holds the user & role data cannot be modified\nmanually and because the broker must be running to manage users and because\nthe broker often needs to be secured from first boot the\nActiveMQBasicSecurityManager has 3 properties to define a user whose\ncredentials can then be used to add other users.\n\nbootstrapUser - the name of the bootstrap user\nbootstrapPassword - the password for the bootstrap user; supports masking\nbootstrapRole - the role of the bootstrap user\n\nThe value specified in the bootstrapRole will need the following permissions\non the activemq.management address:\n\ncreateNonDurableQueue\ncreateAddress\nconsume\nmanage\nsend\n\nFor example:\n\n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n\n\n\nNote:\nIf the 3 bootstrap properties are defined then those credentials will be\nset whenever you start the broker no matter what changes may have been made\nto them at runtime previously.\n\nMapping external roles\nRoles from external authentication providers (i.e. LDAP) can be mapped to internally used roles. The is done through role-mapping entries in the security-settings block:\n\n   [...]\n   \n   \n\n\nNote: Role mapping is additive. That means the user will keep the original role(s) as well as the newly assigned role(s).\nNote: This role mapping only affects the roles which are used to authorize queue access through the configured acceptors. It can not be used to map the role required to access the web console.\nSASL\nAMQP supports SASL. The following mechanisms are supported; PLAIN, EXTERNAL, ANONYMOUS, GSSAPI.\nThe published list can be constrained via the amqp acceptor saslMechanisms property. \nNote: EXTERNAL will only be chosen if a subject is available from the TLS client certificate.\nChanging the username/password for clustering\nIn order for cluster connections to work correctly, each node in the cluster\nmust make connections to the other nodes. The username/password they use for\nthis should always be changed from the installation default to prevent a\nsecurity risk.\nPlease see Management for instructions on how to do this.\nSecuring the console\nArtemis comes with a web console that allows user to browse Artemis\ndocumentation via an embedded server. By default the web access is plain HTTP.\nIt is configured in bootstrap.xml:\n\n    \n\n\nAlternatively you can edit the above configuration to enable secure access\nusing HTTPS protocol. e.g.:\n\n    \n\n\nAs shown in the example, to enable https the first thing to do is config the\nbind to be an https url. In addition, You will have to configure a few\nextra properties desribed as below.\n\nkeyStorePath - The path of the key store file.\n\nkeyStorePassword - The key store's password.\n\nclientAuth - The boolean flag indicates whether or not client\nauthentication is required. Default is false.\n\ntrustStorePath - The path of the trust store file. This is needed only if\nclientAuth is true.\n\ntrustStorePassword - The trust store's password.\n\n\nControlling JMS ObjectMessage deserialization\nArtemis provides a simple class filtering mechanism with which a user can\nspecify which packages are to be trusted and which are not. Objects whose\nclasses are from trusted packages can be deserialized without problem, whereas\nthose from 'not trusted' packages will be denied deserialization.\nArtemis keeps a black list to keep track of packages that are not trusted and\na white list for trusted packages. By default both lists are empty, meaning\nany serializable object is allowed to be deserialized. If an object whose class\nmatches one of the packages in black list, it is not allowed to be\ndeserialized. If it matches one in the white list the object can be\ndeserialized. If a package appears in both black list and white list, the one\nin black list takes precedence. If a class neither matches with black list\nnor with the white list, the class deserialization will be denied unless the\nwhite list is empty (meaning the user doesn't specify the white list at all).\nA class is considered as a 'match' if\n\nits full name exactly matches one of the entries in the list.\nits package matches one of the entries in the list or is a sub-package of one\nof the entries.\n\nFor example, if a class full name is \"org.apache.pkg1.Class1\", some matching\nentries could be:\n\norg.apache.pkg1.Class1 - exact match.\norg.apache.pkg1 - exact package match.\norg.apache -- sub package match.\n\nA * means 'match-all' in a black or white list.\nConfig via Connection Factories\nTo specify the white and black lists one can use the URL parameters\ndeserializationBlackList and deserializationWhiteList. For example, using\nJMS:\nActiveMQConnectionFactory factory = new ActiveMQConnectionFactory(\"vm://0?deserializationBlackList=org.apache.pkg1,org.some.pkg2\");\n\nThe above statement creates a factory that has a black list contains two\nforbidden packages, \"org.apache.pkg1\" and \"org.some.pkg2\", separated by a\ncomma.\nConfig via system properties\nThere are two system properties available for specifying black list and white\nlist:\n\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.jms.deserialization.whitelist - comma separated\nlist of entries for the white list.\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.jms.deserialization.blacklist - comma separated\nlist of entries for the black list.\n\nOnce defined, all JMS object message deserialization in the VM is subject to\nchecks against the two lists. However if you create a ConnectionFactory and set\na new set of black/white lists on it, the new values will override the system\nproperties.\nConfig for resource adapters\nMessage beans using a JMS resource adapter to receive messages can also control\ntheir object deserialization via properly configuring relevant properties for\ntheir resource adapters. There are two properties that you can configure with\nconnection factories in a resource adapter:\n\ndeserializationBlackList - comma separated values for black list\ndeserializationWhiteList - comma separated values for white list\n\nThese properties, once specified, are eventually set on the corresponding\ninternal factories.\nConfig for REST interface\nApache Artemis REST interface (Rest) allows interactions between jms\nclient and rest clients.  It uses JMS ObjectMessage to wrap the actual user\ndata between the 2 types of clients and deserialization is needed during this\nprocess. If you want to control the deserialization for REST, you need to set\nthe black/white lists for it separately as Apache Artemis REST Interface is\ndeployed as a web application.  You need to put the black/white lists in its\nweb.xml, as context parameters, as follows\n\n    \n        org.apache.activemq.artemis.jms.deserialization.whitelist\n        some.allowed.class\n    \n    \n        org.apache.activemq.artemis.jms.deserialization.blacklist\n        some.forbidden.class\n    \n...\n\n\nThe param-value for each list is a comma separated string value representing the list.\nMasking Passwords\nFor details about masking passwords in broker.xml please see the Masking\nPasswords chapter.\nCustom Security Manager\nThe underpinnings of the broker's security implementation can be changed if so\ndesired. The broker uses a component called a \"security manager\" to implement\nthe actual authentication and authorization checks. By default, the broker uses\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.spi.core.security.ActiveMQJAASSecurityManager to\nprovide JAAS integration, but users can provide their own implementation of\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.spi.core.security.ActiveMQSecurityManager3 and\nconfigure it in bootstrap.xml using the security-manager element, e.g.:\n\n\n   \n      \n      \n   \n\n   ...\n\n\nThe security-manager example demonstrates how to do this is more detail.\nPer-Acceptor Security Domains\nIt's possible to override the broker's JAAS security domain by specifying a\nsecurity domain on an individual acceptor. Simply use the securityDomain\nparameter and indicate which domain from your login.config to use, e.g.:\ntcp://127.0.0.1:61616?securityDomain=mySecurityDomain\n\nAny client connecting to this acceptor will be have security enforced using\nmySecurityDomain.\n"},"masking-passwords.html":{"url":"masking-passwords.html","title":"Masking Passwords","keywords":"","body":"Masking Passwords\nBy default all passwords in Apache ActiveMQ Artemis server's configuration\nfiles are in plain text form. This usually poses no security issues as those\nfiles should be well protected from unauthorized accessing. However, in some\ncircumstances a user doesn't want to expose its passwords to more eyes than\nnecessary.\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis can be configured to use 'masked' passwords in its\nconfiguration files. A masked password is an obscure string representation of a\nreal password. To mask a password a user will use an 'codec'. The codec\ntakes in the real password and outputs the masked version. A user can then\nreplace the real password in the configuration files with the new masked\npassword. When Apache ActiveMQ Artemis loads a masked password it uses the\ncodec to decode it back into the real password.\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis provides a default codec. Optionally users can use\nor implement their own codec for masking the passwords.\nIn general, a masked password can be identified using one of two ways. The\nfirst one is the ENC() syntax, i.e. any string value wrapped in ENC() is to\nbe treated as a masked password. For example\nENC(xyz)\nThe above indicates that the password is masked and the masked value is xyz.\nThe ENC() syntax is the preferred way of masking a password and is\nuniversally supported in every password configuration in Artemis.\nThe other, legacy way is to use a mask-password attribute to tell that a \npassword in a configuration file should be treated as 'masked'. For example:\ntrue\nxyz\n\nThis method is now deprecated and exists only to maintain\nbackward-compatibility.  Newer configurations may not support it.\nGenerating a Masked Password\nTo get a mask for a password using the broker's default codec run the\nmask command from your Artemis instance. This command will not work\nfrom the Artemis home:\n./artemis mask \n\nYou'll get something like\nresult: 32c6f67dae6cd61b0a7ad1702033aa81e6b2a760123f4360\nJust copy 32c6f67dae6cd61b0a7ad1702033aa81e6b2a760123f4360 and replace your\nplaintext password with it using the ENC() syntax, e.g. \nENC(32c6f67dae6cd61b0a7ad1702033aa81e6b2a760123f4360).\nThis process works for passwords in:\n\nbroker.xml\nlogin.config\nbootstrap.xml\nmanagement.xml\n\nThis process does not work for passwords in:\n\nartemis-users.properties\n\nMaksed passwords for artemis-users.properties can be generated using the\nmask command using the --hash command-line option. However, we recommend\nusing the set of tools provided by the user command described below.\nMasking Configuration\nBesides supporting the ENC() syntax, the server configuration file (i.e.\nbroker.xml) has a property that defines the default masking behaviors over the\nentire file scope.\nmask-password: this boolean type property indicates if a password should be\nmasked or not. Set it to \"true\" if you want your passwords masked. The default\nvalue is \"false\". As noted above, this configuration parameter is deprecated.\npassword-codec: this string type property identifies the name of the class\nwhich will be used to decode the masked password within the broker. If not\nspecified then the default\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.utils.DefaultSensitiveStringCodec will be used.\nartemis-users.properties\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis's built-in security manager uses plain properties files\nwhere the user passwords are specified in a hashed form by default. Note, the\npasswords are technically hashed rather than masked in this context. The\ndefault PropertiesLoginModule will not decode the passwords in\nartemis-users.properties but will instead hash the input and compare the two\nhashed values for password verification.\nUse the following command from the CLI of the Aremtis instance you wish to\nadd the user/password to. This command will not work from the Artemis home\nused to create the instance. For example:\n./artemis user add --user guest --password guest --role admin\n\nThis will use the default codec to perform a \"one-way\" hash of the password\nand alter both the artemis-users.properties and artemis-roles.properties\nfiles with the specified values.\nPasswords in artemis-users.properties are automatically detected as hashed or\nnot by looking for the syntax ENC(). The mask-password parameter does\nnot need to be true to use hashed passwords here.\ncluster-password\nIf it is specified in ENC() syntax it will be treated as masked, or\nif mask-password is true the cluster-password will be treated as masked.\nConnectors & Acceptors\nIn broker.xml connector and acceptor configurations sometimes needs to\nspecify passwords. For example, if a user wants to use an acceptor with\nsslEnabled=true it can specify keyStorePassword and trustStorePassword.\nBecause Acceptors and Connectors are pluggable implementations, each transport\nwill have different password masking needs.\nThe preferred way is simply to use the ENC() syntax.\nIf using the legacy mask-password and password-codec values then when a\nconnector or acceptor is initialised, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis will add\nthese values to the parameters using the keys activemq.usemaskedpassword\nand activemq.passwordcodec respectively. The Netty and InVM implementations\nwill use these as needed and any other implementations will have access to\nthese to use if they so wish.\nCore Bridges\nCore Bridges are configured in the server configuration file and so the masking\nof its password properties follows the same rules as that of\ncluster-password. It supports ENC() syntax.\nFor using mask-password property, the following table summarizes the\nrelations among the above-mentioned properties\n\n\n\nmask-password\ncluster-password\nacceptor/connector passwords\nbridge password\n\n\n\n\nabsent\nplain text\nplain text\nplain text\n\n\nfalse\nplain text\nplain text\nplain text\n\n\ntrue\nmasked\nmasked\nmasked\n\n\n\nIt is recommended that you use the ENC() syntax for new applications/deployments.\nExamples\nNote: In the following examples if related attributed or properties are\nabsent, it means they are not specified in the configure file.\n\nUnmasked\nbbc\n\nThis indicates the cluster password is a plain text value bbc.\n\nMasked 1\nENC(80cf731af62c290)\n\nThis indicates the cluster password is a masked value 80cf731af62c290.\n\nMasked 2\ntrue\n80cf731af62c290\n\nThis indicates the cluster password is a masked value and Apache ActiveMQ\nArtemis will use its built-in codec to decode it. All other passwords in the\nconfiguration file, Connectors, Acceptors and Bridges, will also use masked\npasswords.\n\n\nbootstrap.xml\nThe broker embeds a web-server for hosting some web applications such as a\nmanagement console. It is configured in bootstrap.xml as a web component. The\nweb server can be secured using the https protocol, and it can be configured \nwith a keystore password and/or truststore password which by default are \nspecified in plain text forms.\nTo mask these passwords you need to use ENC() syntax. The mask-password\nboolean is not supported here.\nYou can also set the passwordCodec attribute if you want to use a password\ncodec other than the default one. For example\n\n    \n\n\nmanagement.xml\nThe broker embeds a JMX connector which is used for management. The connector can\nbe secured using SSL and it can be configured with a keystore password and/or\ntruststore password which by default are specified in plain text forms.\nTo mask these passwords you need to use ENC() syntax. The mask-password\nboolean is not supported here.\nYou can also set the password-codec attribute if you want to use a password\ncodec other than the default one. For example\n\n\nWith this configuration, both passwords in ra.xml and all of its MDBs will have\nto be in masked form.\nlogin.config\nArtemis supports LDAP login modules to be configured in JAAS configuration file\n(default name is login.config). When connecting to a LDAP server usually you\nneed to supply a connection password in the config file. By default this\npassword is in plain text form.\nTo mask it you need to configure the passwords in your login module using\nENC() syntax. To specify a codec using the following property:\npasswordCodec - the password codec class name. (the default codec will be\nused if it is absent)\nFor example:\nLDAPLoginExternalPasswordCodec {\n    org.apache.activemq.artemis.spi.core.security.jaas.LDAPLoginModule required\n        debug=true\n        initialContextFactory=com.sun.jndi.ldap.LdapCtxFactory\n        connectionURL=\"ldap://localhost:1024\"\n        connectionUsername=\"uid=admin,ou=system\"\n        connectionPassword=\"ENC(-170b9ef34d79ed12)\"\n        passwordCodec=\"org.apache.activemq.artemis.utils.DefaultSensitiveStringCodec;key=helloworld\"\n        connectionProtocol=s\n        authentication=simple\n        userBase=\"ou=system\"\n        userSearchMatching=\"(uid={0})\"\n        userSearchSubtree=false\n        roleBase=\"ou=system\"\n        roleName=dummyRoleName\n        roleSearchMatching=\"(uid={1})\"\n        roleSearchSubtree=false\n        ;\n};\nJCA Resource Adapter\nBoth ra.xml and MDB activation configuration have a password property that\ncan be masked preferably using ENC() syntax.\nAlternatively it can use an optional attribute in ra.xml to indicate that a\npassword is masked:\nUseMaskedPassword -- If setting to \"true\" the passwords are masked.  Default\nis false.\nThere is another property in ra.xml that can specify a codec:\nPasswordCodec -- Class name and its parameters for the codec used to decode\nthe masked password. Ignored if UseMaskedPassword is false. The format of this\nproperty is a full qualified class name optionally followed by key/value pairs.\nIt is the same format as that for JMS Bridges. Example:\nExample 1 Using the ENC() syntax:\n\n  password\n  String\n  ENC(80cf731af62c290)\n\n\n  PasswordCodec\n  java.lang.String\n  com.foo.ACodec;key=helloworld\n\n\nExample 2 Using the \"UseMaskedPassword\" property:\n\n  UseMaskedPassword\n  boolean\n  true\n\n\n  password\n  String\n  80cf731af62c290\n\n\n  PasswordCodec\n  java.lang.String\n  com.foo.ACodec;key=helloworld\n\n\nChoosing a codec for password masking\nAs described in the previous sections, all password masking requires a codec.\nA codec uses an algorithm to convert a masked password into its original\nclear text form in order to be used in various security operations. The\nalgorithm used for decoding must match that for encoding. Otherwise the\ndecoding may not be successful.\nFor user's convenience Apache ActiveMQ Artemis provides a default codec.\nHowever a user can implement their own if they wish.\nThe Default Codec\nWhenever no codec is specified in the configuration, the default codec\nis used. The class name for the default codec is\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.utils.DefaultSensitiveStringCodec. It has\nhashing, encoding, and decoding capabilities. It uses java.crypto.Cipher\nutilities to hash or encode a plaintext password and also to decode a masked\nstring using the same algorithm and key.\nUsing a custom codec\nIt is possible to use a custom codec rather than the built-in one.  Simply\nmake sure the codec is in Apache ActiveMQ Artemis's classpath. The custom\ncodec can also be service loaded rather than class loaded, if the codec's\nservice provider is installed in the classpath.  Then configure the server to\nuse it as follows:\ncom.foo.SomeCodec;key1=value1;key2=value2\n\nIf your codec needs params passed to it you can do this via key/value pairs\nwhen configuring. For instance if your codec needs say a \"key-location\"\nparameter, you can define like so:\ncom.foo.NewCodec;key-location=/some/url/to/keyfile\n\nThen configure your cluster-password like this:\nENC(masked_password)\n\nWhen Apache ActiveMQ Artemis reads the cluster-password it will initialize the\nNewCodec and use it to decode \"mask_password\". It also process all passwords\nusing the new defined codec.\nImplementing Custom Codecs\nTo use a different codec than the built-in one, you either pick one from\nexisting libraries or you implement it yourself. All codecs must implement\nthe org.apache.activemq.artemis.utils.SensitiveDataCodec interface:\npublic interface SensitiveDataCodec {\n\n   T decode(Object mask) throws Exception;\n\n   T encode(Object secret) throws Exception;\n\n   default void init(Map params) throws Exception {\n   };\n}\n\nThis is a generic type interface but normally for a password you just need\nString type. So a new codec would be defined like\npublic class MyCodec implements SensitiveDataCodec {\n   @Override\n   public String decode(Object mask) throws Exception {\n      // Decode the mask into clear text password.\n      return \"the password\";\n   }\n\n   @Override\n   public String encode(Object secret) throws Exception {\n      // Mask the clear text password.\n      return \"the masked password\"\";\n   }\n\n   @Override\n   public void init(Map params) {\n      // Initialization done here. It is called right after the codec has been created.\n   }\n}\n\nLast but not least, once you get your own codec please add it to the\nclasspath otherwise the broker\nwill fail to load it!\n"},"broker-plugins.html":{"url":"broker-plugins.html","title":"Broker Plugins","keywords":"","body":"Apache ActiveMQ Artemis Plugin Support\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis is designed to allow extra functionality to be added by\ncreating a plugin.

The JMS Bridge may be useful for fast\ntransfers as this chapter covers, but keep in mind that more complex\nscenarios requiring transformations will require you to use a more advanced\ntransformation system that will play on use cases that will go beyond Apache\nActiveMQ Artemis.\n\nThe source and target servers do not have to be in the same cluster which makes\nbridging suitable for reliably sending messages from one cluster to another,\nfor instance across a WAN, and where the connection may be unreliable.\nA bridge can be deployed as a standalone application or as a web application\nmanaged by the embedded Jetty instance bootstrapped with Apache ActiveMQ\nArtemis. The source and the target can be located in the same virtual machine\nor another one.\nThe bridge can also be used to bridge messages from other non Apache ActiveMQ\nArtemis JMS servers, as long as they are JMS 1.1 compliant.\n\nNote:\nDo not confuse a JMS bridge with a core bridge. A JMS bridge can be used to\nbridge any two JMS 1.1 compliant JMS providers and uses the JMS API. A core\nbridge) is used to bridge any two Apache ActiveMQ Artemis\ninstances and uses the core API. Always use a core bridge if you can in\npreference to a JMS bridge. The core bridge will typically provide better\nperformance than a JMS bridge. Also the core bridge can provide once and\nonly once delivery guarantees without using XA.\n\nThe bridge has built-in resilience to failure so if the source or target server\nconnection is lost, e.g. due to network failure, the bridge will retry\nconnecting to the source and/or target until they come back online. When it\ncomes back online it will resume operation as normal.\nThe bridge can be configured with an optional JMS selector, so it will only\nconsume messages matching that JMS selector\nIt can be configured to consume from a queue or a topic.

This bean is used to create the source Destination\n\nTarget Destination Factory Factory\nThis injects the TargetDestinationFactory bean (also defined in the beans\nfile). This bean is used to create the target Destination\n\nSource User Name\nthis parameter is the username for creating the source connection\n\nSource Password\nthis parameter is the parameter for creating the source connection\n\nTarget User Name\nthis parameter is the username for creating the target connection\n\nTarget Password\nthis parameter is the password for creating the target connection\n\nSelector\nThis represents a JMS selector expression used for consuming\nmessages from the source destination. Only messages that match the\nselector expression will be bridged from the source to the target\ndestination\nThe selector expression must follow the JMS selector\nsyntax\n\nFailure Retry Interval\nThis represents the amount of time in ms to wait between trying to recreate\nconnections to the source or target servers when the bridge has detected they\nhave failed\n\nMax Retries\nThis represents the number of times to attempt to recreate connections to the\nsource or target servers when the bridge has detected they have failed. The\nbridge will give up after trying this number of times. -1 represents 'try\nforever'\n\nQuality Of Service\nThis parameter represents the desired quality of service mode\nPossible values are:\n\nAT_MOST_ONCE\n\nDUPLICATES_OK\n\nONCE_AND_ONLY_ONCE\n\n\nSee Quality Of Service section for an explanation of these modes.\n\nMax Batch Size\nThis represents the maximum number of messages to consume from the source\ndestination before sending them in a batch to the target destination. Its value\nmust >= 1\n\nMax Batch Time\nThis represents the maximum number of milliseconds to wait before sending a\nbatch to target, even if the number of messages consumed has not reached\nMaxBatchSize. Its value must be -1 to represent 'wait forever', or >= 1\nto specify an actual time\n\nSubscription Name\nIf the source destination represents a topic, and you want to consume from\nthe topic using a durable subscription then this parameter represents the\ndurable subscription name\n\nClient ID\nIf the source destination represents a topic, and you want to consume from\nthe topic using a durable subscription then this attribute represents the the\nJMS client ID to use when creating/looking up the durable subscription\n\nAdd MessageID In Header\nIf true, then the original message's message ID will be appended in the\nmessage sent to the destination in the header ACTIVEMQ_BRIDGE_MSG_ID_LIST. If\nthe message is bridged more than once, each message ID will be appended. This\nenables a distributed request-response pattern to be used\n\nNote:\nwhen you receive the message you can send back a response using the\ncorrelation id of the first message id, so when the original sender gets it\nback it will be able to correlate it.\n\n\nMBean Server\nTo manage the JMS Bridge using JMX, set the MBeanServer where the JMS Bridge\nMBean must be registered (e.g. the JVM Platform MBeanServer)\n\nObjectName\nIf you set the MBeanServer, you also need to set the ObjectName used to\nregister the JMS Bridge MBean (must be unique)\n\n\nThe \"transactionManager\" property points to a JTA transaction manager\nimplementation and should be set if you need to use the 'ONCE_AND_ONCE_ONLY'\nQuality of Service. Apache ActiveMQ Artemis doesn't ship with such an\nimplementation, but if you are running within an Application Server you can\ninject the Transaction Manager that is shipped.\nSource and Target Connection Factories\nThe source and target connection factory factories are used to create the\nconnection factory used to create the connection for the source or target\nserver.\nThe configuration example above uses the default implementation provided by\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis that looks up the connection factory using JNDI. For\nother Application Servers or JMS providers a new implementation may have to be\nprovided. This can easily be done by implementing the interface\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.jms.bridge.ConnectionFactoryFactory.\nSource and Target Destination Factories\nAgain, similarly, these are used to create or lookup up the destinations.\nIn the configuration example above, we have used the default provided by Apache\nActiveMQ Artemis that looks up the destination using JNDI.\nA new implementation can be provided by implementing\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.jms.bridge.DestinationFactory interface.\nQuality Of Service\nThe quality of service modes used by the bridge are described here in more\ndetail.\nAT_MOST_ONCE\nWith this QoS mode messages will reach the destination from the source at most\nonce. The messages are consumed from the source and acknowledged before sending\nto the destination. Therefore there is a possibility that if failure occurs\nbetween removing them from the source and them arriving at the destination they\ncould be lost. Hence delivery will occur at most once.\nThis mode is available for both durable and non-durable messages.\nDUPLICATES_OK\nWith this QoS mode, the messages are consumed from the source and then\nacknowledged after they have been successfully sent to the destination.\nTherefore there is a possibility that if failure occurs after sending to the\ndestination but before acknowledging them, they could be sent again when the\nsystem recovers. I.e. the destination might receive duplicates after a failure.\nThis mode is available for both durable and non-durable messages.\nONCE_AND_ONLY_ONCE\nThis QoS mode ensures messages will reach the destination from the source once\nand only once. (Sometimes this mode is known as \"exactly once\"). If both the\nsource and the destination are on the same Apache ActiveMQ Artemis server\ninstance then this can be achieved by sending and acknowledging the messages in\nthe same local transaction. If the source and destination are on different\nservers this is achieved by enlisting the sending and consuming sessions in a\nJTA transaction. The JTA transaction is controlled by a JTA Transaction Manager\nwhich will need to be set via the settransactionManager method on the Bridge.\nThis mode is only available for durable messages.\n\nNote:\nFor a specific application it may possible to provide once and only once\nsemantics without using the ONCE_AND_ONLY_ONCE QoS level. This can be done\nby using the DUPLICATES_OK mode and then checking for duplicates at the\ndestination and discarding them. Some JMS servers provide automatic duplicate\nmessage detection functionality, or this may be possible to implement on the\napplication level by maintaining a cache of received message ids on disk and\ncomparing received messages to them. The cache would only be valid for a\ncertain period of time so this approach is not as watertight as using\nONCE_AND_ONLY_ONCE but may be a good choice depending on your specific\napplication.\n\nTime outs and the JMS bridge\nThere is a possibility that the target or source server will not be available\nat some point in time. If this occurs then the bridge will try Max Retries to\nreconnect every Failure Retry Interval milliseconds as specified in the JMS\nBridge definition.\nIf you implement your own factories for looking up JMS resources then you will\nhave to bear in mind timeout issues.\nExamples\nPlease see JMS Bridge Example which shows how to\nprogrammatically instantiate and configure a JMS Bridge to send messages to the\nsource destination and consume them from the target destination between two\nstandalone Apache ActiveMQ Artemis brokers.\n"},"client-reconnection.html":{"url":"client-reconnection.html","title":"Client Reconnection and Session Reattachment","keywords":"","body":"Client Reconnection and Session Reattachment\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis clients can be configured to automatically reconnect or\nre-attach to the server in the event that a failure is detected in the\nconnection between the client and the server.\n100% Transparent session re-attachment\nIf the failure was due to some transient failure such as a temporary network\nfailure, and the target server was not restarted, then the sessions will still\nbe existent on the server, assuming the client hasn't been disconnected for\nmore than connection-ttl\nIn this scenario, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis will automatically re-attach the\nclient sessions to the server sessions when the connection reconnects. This is\ndone 100% transparently and the client can continue exactly as if nothing had\nhappened.\nThe way this works is as follows:\nAs Apache ActiveMQ Artemis clients send commands to their servers they store\neach sent command in an in-memory buffer. In the case that connection failure\noccurs and the client subsequently reattaches to the same server, as part of\nthe reattachment protocol the server informs the client during reattachment\nwith the id of the last command it successfully received from that client.\nIf the client has sent more commands than were received before failover it can\nreplay any sent commands from its buffer so that the client and server can\nreconcile their states.Ac\nThe size of this buffer is configured with the confirmationWindowSize\nparameter on the connection URL. When the server has received\nconfirmationWindowSize bytes of commands and processed them it will send back\na command confirmation to the client, and the client can then free up space in\nthe buffer.\nThe window is specified in bytes.\nSetting this parameter to -1 disables any buffering and prevents any\nre-attachment from occurring, forcing reconnect instead. The default value for\nthis parameter is -1. (Which means by default no auto re-attachment will\noccur)\nSession reconnection\nAlternatively, the server might have actually been restarted after crashing or\nbeing stopped. In this case any sessions will no longer be existent on the\nserver and it won't be possible to 100% transparently re-attach to them.\nIn this case, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis will automatically reconnect the\nconnection and recreate any sessions and consumers on the server\ncorresponding to the sessions and consumers on the client. This process is\nexactly the same as what happens during failover onto a backup server.\nClient reconnection is also used internally by components such as core bridges\nto allow them to reconnect to their target servers.\nPlease see the section on failover Automatic Client Failover to get a\nfull understanding of how transacted and non-transacted sessions are\nreconnected during failover/reconnect and what you need to do to maintain once\nand only once delivery guarantees.\nConfiguring reconnection/reattachment attributes\nClient reconnection is configured using the following parameters:\n\nretryInterval. This optional parameter determines the period in\nmilliseconds between subsequent reconnection attempts, if the connection to\nthe target server has failed. The default value is 2000 milliseconds.\n\nretryIntervalMultiplier. This optional parameter determines determines a\nmultiplier to apply to the time since the last retry to compute the time to\nthe next retry.\nThis allows you to implement an exponential backoff between retry attempts.\nLet's take an example:\nIf we set retryInterval to 1000 ms and we set retryIntervalMultiplier\nto 2.0, then, if the first reconnect attempt fails, we will wait 1000 ms\nthen 2000 ms then 4000 ms between subsequent reconnection attempts.\nThe default value is 1.0 meaning each reconnect attempt is spaced at equal\nintervals.\n\nmaxRetryInterval. This optional parameter determines the maximum retry\ninterval that will be used. When setting retryIntervalMultiplier it would\notherwise be possible that subsequent retries exponentially increase to\nridiculously large values. By setting this parameter you can set an upper limit\non that value. The default value is 2000 milliseconds.\n\nreconnectAttempts. This optional parameter determines the total number of\nreconnect attempts to make before giving up and shutting down. A value of\n-1 signifies an unlimited number of attempts. The default value is 0.\n\n\nAll of these parameters are set on the URL used to connect to the broker.\nIf your client does manage to reconnect but the session is no longer available\non the server, for instance if the server has been restarted or it has timed\nout, then the client won't be able to re-attach, and any ExceptionListener or\nFailureListener instances registered on the connection or session will be\ncalled.\nExceptionListeners and SessionFailureListeners\nPlease note, that when a client reconnects or re-attaches, any registered JMS\nExceptionListener or core API SessionFailureListener will be called.\n"},"diverts.html":{"url":"diverts.html","title":"Diverting and Splitting Message Flows","keywords":"","body":"Diverting and Splitting Message Flows\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis allows you to configure objects called diverts with some\nsimple server configuration.\nDiverts allow you to transparently divert messages routed to one address\nto some other address, without making any changes to any client\napplication logic.\nDiverts can be exclusive, meaning that the message is diverted to the\nnew address, and does not go to the old address at all, or they can be\nnon-exclusive which means the message continues to go the old address,\nand a copy of it is also sent to the new address. Non-exclusive\ndiverts can therefore be used for splitting message flows, e.g. there\nmay be a requirement to monitor every order sent to an order queue.\nWhen an address has both exclusive and non-exclusive diverts configured,\nthe exclusive ones are processed first. If any of the exclusive diverts\ndiverted the message, the non-exclusive ones are not processed.\nDiverts can also be configured to have an optional message filter. If\nspecified then only messages that match the filter will be diverted.\nDiverts can apply a particular routing-type to the message, strip the\nexisting routing type, or simply pass the existing routing-type through.\nThis is useful in situations where the message may have its routing-type\nset but you want to divert it to an address using a different routing-type.\nIt's important to keep in mind that a message with the anycast\nrouting-type will not actually be routed to queues using multicast and\nvice-versa. By configuring the routing-type of the divert you have the\nflexibility to deal with any situation. Valid values are ANYCAST,\nMULTICAST, PASS, & STRIP. The default is STRIP.\nDiverts can also be configured to apply a Transformer.\nIf specified, all diverted messages will have the opportunity of being\ntransformed by the Transformer. When an address has multiple diverts\nconfigured, all of them receive the same, original message. This means that\nthe results of a transformer on a message are not directly available for\nother diverts or their filters on the same address.\nSee the documentation on adding runtime dependencies to \nunderstand how to make your transformer available to the broker.\nA divert will only divert a message to an address on the same server,\nhowever, if you want to divert to an address on a different server, a\ncommon pattern would be to divert to a local store-and-forward queue,\nthen set up a bridge which consumes from that queue and forwards to an\naddress on a different server.\nDiverts are therefore a very sophisticated concept, which when combined\nwith bridges can be used to create interesting and complex routings. The\nset of diverts on a server can be thought of as a type of routing table\nfor messages. Combining diverts with bridges allows you to create a\ndistributed network of reliable routing connections between multiple\ngeographically distributed servers, creating your global messaging mesh.\nDiverts are defined as xml in the broker.xml file at the core attribute level.\nThere can be zero or more diverts in the file.\nDiverted messages get special properties.\nPlease see the examples for a full working example showing you how to\nconfigure and use diverts.\nLet's take a look at some divert examples:\nExclusive Divert\nLet's take a look at an exclusive divert. An exclusive divert diverts\nall matching messages that are routed to the old address to the new\naddress. Matching messages do not get routed to the old address.\nHere's some example xml configuration for an exclusive divert, it's\ntaken from the divert example:\n\n   priceUpdates\n   priceForwarding\n   \n   \n      org.apache.activemq.artemis.jms.example.AddForwardingTimeTransformer\n   \n   true\n\n\nWe define a divert called prices-divert that will divert any\nmessages sent to the address priceUpdates to another local address \npriceForwarding.\nWe also specify a message filter string so only messages with the\nmessage property office with value New York will get diverted, all\nother messages will continue to be routed to the normal address. The\nfilter string is optional, if not specified then all messages will be\nconsidered matched.\nIn this example a transformer class is specified without any configuration\nproperties. Again this is optional, and if specified the transformer will\nbe executed for each matching message. This allows you to change the\nmessages body or properties before it is diverted. In this example the\ntransformer simply adds a header that records the time the divert happened.\nSee the transformer chapter for more details about\ntransformer-specific configuration.\nThis example is actually diverting messages to a local store and forward\nqueue, which is configured with a bridge which forwards the message to\nan address on another ActiveMQ Artemis server. Please see the example for\nmore details.\nNon-exclusive Divert\nNow we'll take a look at a non-exclusive divert. Non exclusive diverts\nare the same as exclusive diverts, but they only forward a copy of the\nmessage to the new address. The original message continues to the old\naddress\nYou can therefore think of non-exclusive diverts as splitting a\nmessage flow.\nNon exclusive diverts can be configured in the same way as exclusive\ndiverts with an optional filter and transformer, here's an example\nnon-exclusive divert, again from the divert example:\n\n   orders\n   spyTopic\n   false\n\n\nThe above divert example takes a copy of every message sent to the\naddress 'orders' and sends it to a local address called\n'spyTopic'.\n"},"core-bridges.html":{"url":"core-bridges.html","title":"Core Bridges","keywords":"","body":"Core Bridges\nThe function of a bridge is to consume messages from a source queue, and\nforward them to a target address, typically on a different Apache ActiveMQ\nArtemis server.\nThe source and target servers do not have to be in the same cluster which makes\nbridging suitable for reliably sending messages from one cluster to another,\nfor instance across a WAN, or internet and where the connection may be\nunreliable.\nThe bridge has built in resilience to failure so if the target server\nconnection is lost, e.g. due to network failure, the bridge will retry\nconnecting to the target until it comes back online.

With a core bridge both source and target servers\nmust be Apache ActiveMQ Artemis servers.\nBridges can be configured to provide once and only once delivery guarantees\neven in the event of the failure of the source or the target server. They do\nthis by using duplicate detection (described in Duplicate\nDetection).\n\nNote:\nAlthough they have similar function, don't confuse core bridges with JMS\nbridges!\nCore bridges are for linking an Apache ActiveMQ Artemis node with another\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis node and do not use the JMS API. A JMS Bridge is used\nfor linking any two JMS 1.1 compliant JMS providers. So, a JMS Bridge could\nbe used for bridging to or from different JMS compliant messaging system.\nIt's always preferable to use a core bridge if you can. Core bridges use\nduplicate detection to provide once and only once guarantees. To provide\nthe same guarantee using a JMS bridge you would have to use XA which has a\nhigher overhead and is more complex to configure.\n\nConfiguring Bridges\nBridges are configured in broker.xml. Let's kick off with an example (this is\nactually from the bridge example):\n\n   sausage-factory\n   mincing-machine\n   \n   \n      org.apache.activemq.artemis.jms.example.HatColourChangeTransformer\n   \n   1000\n   true\n   1.0\n   -1\n   -1\n   false\n   true\n   10000000\n   foouser\n   foopassword\n   PASS\n   \n      remote-connector\n   \n   \n   -->\n\n\nIn the above example we have shown all the parameters its possible to configure\nfor a bridge. In practice you might use many of the defaults so it won't be\nnecessary to specify them all explicitly.\nLet's take a look at all the parameters in turn:\n\nname attribute. All bridges must have a unique name in the server.\n\nqueue-name. This is the unique name of the local queue that the bridge\nconsumes from, it's a mandatory parameter.\nThe queue must already exist by the time the bridge is instantiated at\nstart-up.\n\nforwarding-address. This is the address on the target server that the\nmessage will be forwarded to. If a forwarding address is not specified, then\nthe original address of the message will be retained.\n\nfilter-string. An optional filter string can be supplied. If specified then\nonly messages which match the filter expression specified in the filter\nstring will be forwarded. The filter string follows the ActiveMQ Artemis filter\nexpression syntax described in Filter Expressions.\n\ntransformer-class-name. An optional transformer can be specified. This\ngives you the opportunity to transform the message's header or body before\nforwarding it. See the transformer chapter for more details\nabout transformer-specific configuration.\n\nha. This optional parameter determines whether or not this bridge should\nsupport high availability. True means it will connect to any available server\nin a cluster and support failover. The default value is false.\n\nretry-interval. This optional parameter determines the period in\nmilliseconds between subsequent reconnection attempts, if the connection to\nthe target server has failed. The default value is 2000milliseconds.\n\nretry-interval-multiplier. This optional parameter determines determines a\nmultiplier to apply to the time since the last retry to compute the time to\nthe next retry.\nThis allows you to implement an exponential backoff between retry\nattempts.\nLet's take an example:\nIf we set retry-intervalto 1000 ms and we set retry-interval-multiplier\nto 2.0, then, if the first reconnect attempt fails, we will wait 1000 ms\nthen 2000 ms then 4000 ms between subsequent reconnection attempts.\nThe default value is 1.0 meaning each reconnect attempt is spaced at equal\nintervals.\n\ninitial-connect-attempts. This optional parameter determines the total\nnumber of initial connect attempts the bridge will make before giving up and\nshutting down. A value of -1 signifies an unlimited number of attempts. The\ndefault value is -1.\n\nreconnect-attempts. This optional parameter determines the total number of\nreconnect attempts the bridge will make before giving up and shutting down. A\nvalue of -1 signifies an unlimited number of attempts. The default value is\n-1.\n\nfailover-on-server-shutdown. This optional parameter determines whether the\nbridge will attempt to failover onto a backup server (if specified) when the\ntarget server is cleanly shutdown rather than crashed.\nThe bridge connector can specify both a live and a backup server, if it\nspecifies a backup server and this parameter is set to true then if the\ntarget server is cleanly shutdown the bridge connection will attempt to\nfailover onto its backup. If the bridge connector has no backup server\nconfigured then this parameter has no effect.\nSometimes you want a bridge configured with a live and a backup target\nserver, but you don't want to failover to the backup if the live server is\nsimply taken down temporarily for maintenance, this is when this parameter\ncomes in handy.\nThe default value for this parameter is false.\n\nuse-duplicate-detection. This optional parameter determines whether the\nbridge will automatically insert a duplicate id property into each message\nthat it forwards.\nDoing so, allows the target server to perform duplicate detection on messages\nit receives from the source server. If the connection fails or server crashes,\nthen, when the bridge resumes it will resend unacknowledged messages. This\nmight result in duplicate messages being sent to the target server. By enabling\nduplicate detection allows these duplicates to be screened out and ignored.\nThis allows the bridge to provide a once and only once delivery guarantee\nwithout using heavyweight methods such as XA (see Duplicate\nDetection for more information).\nThe default value for this parameter is true.\n\nconfirmation-window-size. This optional parameter determines the\nconfirmation-window-size to use for the connection used to forward messages\nto the target node. This attribute is described in section Reconnection and\nSession Reattachment\n\nWarning\nWhen using the bridge to forward messages to an address which uses the\nBLOCK address-full-policy from a queue which has a max-size-bytes set\nit's important that confirmation-window-size is less than or equal to\nmax-size-bytes to prevent the flow of messages from ceasing.\n\n\nproducer-window-size. This optional parameter determines the producer flow\ncontrol through the bridge. You usually leave this off unless you are dealing\nwith huge large messages. \nDefault=-1 (disabled)\n\nuser. This optional parameter determines the user name to use when creating\nthe bridge connection to the remote server. If it is not specified the\ndefault cluster user specified by cluster-user in broker.xml will be used.\n\npassword. This optional parameter determines the password to use when\ncreating the bridge connection to the remote server. If it is not specified\nthe default cluster password specified by cluster-password in broker.xml\nwill be used.\n\nrouting-type. Bridges can apply a particular routing-type to the messages it\nforwards, strip the existing routing type, or simply pass the existing\nrouting-type through. This is useful in situations where the message may have\nits routing-type set but you want to bridge it to an address using a different\nrouting-type. It's important to keep in mind that a message with the anycast\nrouting-type will not actually be routed to queues using multicast and\nvice-versa. By configuring the routing-type of the bridge you have the\nflexibility to deal with any situation. Valid values are ANYCAST,\nMULTICAST, PASS, & STRIP. The default is PASS.\n\nstatic-connectors or discovery-group-ref. Pick either of these options to\nconnect the bridge to the target server.\nThe static-connectors is a list of connector-ref elements pointing to\nconnector elements defined elsewhere. A connector encapsulates knowledge of\nwhat transport to use (TCP, SSL, HTTP etc) as well as the server connection\nparameters (host, port etc). For more information about what connectors are and\nhow to configure them, please see Configuring the\nTransport.\nThe discovery-group-ref element has one attribute - discovery-group-name.\nThis attribute points to a discovery-group defined elsewhere. For more\ninformation about what discovery-groups are and how to configure them, please\nsee Discovery Groups.\n\n\n"},"transformers.html":{"url":"transformers.html","title":"Transformers","keywords":"","body":"Transformers\nA transfomer, as the name suggests, is a component which transforms a message.\nFor example, a transformer could modify the body of a message or add or remove\nproperties.

This chapter\nwill explain what duplicate detection is, how Apache ActiveMQ Artemis uses it and how\nand where to configure it.\nWhen sending messages from a client to a server, or indeed from a server\nto another server, if the target server or connection fails sometime\nafter sending the message, but before the sender receives a response\nthat the send (or commit) was processed successfully then the sender\ncannot know for sure if the message was sent successfully to the\naddress.\nIf the target server or connection failed after the send was received\nand processed but before the response was sent back then the message\nwill have been sent to the address successfully, but if the target\nserver or connection failed before the send was received and finished\nprocessing then it will not have been sent to the address successfully.\nFrom the senders point of view it's not possible to distinguish these\ntwo cases.\nWhen the server recovers this leaves the client in a difficult\nsituation. It knows the target server failed, but it does not know if\nthe last message reached its destination ok. If it decides to resend the\nlast message, then that could result in a duplicate message being sent\nto the address. If each message was an order or a trade then this could\nresult in the order being fulfilled twice or the trade being double\nbooked. This is clearly not a desirable situation.\nSending the message(s) in a transaction does not help out either. If the\nserver or connection fails while the transaction commit is being\nprocessed it is also indeterminate whether the transaction was\nsuccessfully committed or not!\nTo solve these issues Apache ActiveMQ Artemis provides automatic duplicate messages\ndetection for messages sent to addresses.\nUsing Duplicate Detection for Message Sending\nEnabling duplicate message detection for sent messages is simple: you\njust need to set a special property on the message to a unique value.\nYou can create the value however you like, as long as it is unique. When\nthe target server receives the message it will check if that property is\nset, if it is, then it will check in its in memory cache if it has\nalready received a message with that value of the header. If it has\nreceived a message with the same value before then it will ignore the\nmessage.\n\nNote:\nUsing duplicate detection to move messages between nodes can give you\nthe same once and only once delivery guarantees as if you were using\nan XA transaction to consume messages from source and send them to the\ntarget, but with less overhead and much easier configuration than\nusing XA.\n\nIf you're sending messages in a transaction then you don't have to set\nthe property for every message you send in that transaction, you only\nneed to set it once in the transaction. If the server detects a\nduplicate message for any message in the transaction, then it will\nignore the entire transaction.\nThe name of the property that you set is given by the value of\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.api.core.Message.HDR_DUPLICATE_DETECTION_ID, which\nis _AMQ_DUPL_ID\nThe value of the property can be of type byte[] or SimpleString if\nyou're using the core API. If you're using JMS it must be a String,\nand its value should be unique. An easy way of generating a unique id is\nby generating a UUID.\nHere's an example of setting the property using the core API:\n...\n\nClientMessage message = session.createMessage(true);\n\nSimpleString myUniqueID = \"This is my unique id\";   // Could use a UUID for this\n\nmessage.setStringProperty(HDR_DUPLICATE_DETECTION_ID, myUniqueID);\n\nAnd here's an example using the JMS API:\n...\n\nMessage jmsMessage = session.createMessage();\n\nString myUniqueID = \"This is my unique id\";   // Could use a UUID for this\n\nmessage.setStringProperty(HDR_DUPLICATE_DETECTION_ID.toString(), myUniqueID);\n\n...\n\nConfiguring the Duplicate ID Cache\nThe server maintains caches of received values of the\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.core.message.impl.HDR_DUPLICATE_DETECTION_ID\nproperty sent to each address. Each address has its own distinct cache.\nThe cache is a circular fixed size cache. If the cache has a maximum\nsize of n elements, then the n + 1th id stored will overwrite the\n0th element in the cache.\nThe maximum size of the cache is configured by the parameter\nid-cache-size in broker.xml, the default value is\n20000 elements.\nThe caches can also be configured to persist to disk or not. This is\nconfigured by the parameter persist-id-cache, also in\nbroker.xml. If this is set to true then each id will\nbe persisted to permanent storage as they are received. The default\nvalue for this parameter is true.\n\nNote:\nWhen choosing a size of the duplicate id cache be sure to set it to a\nlarger enough size so if you resend messages all the previously sent\nones are in the cache not having been overwritten.\n\nDuplicate Detection and Bridges\nCore bridges can be configured to automatically add a unique duplicate\nid value (if there isn't already one in the message) before forwarding\nthe message to its target. This ensures that if the target server\ncrashes or the connection is interrupted and the bridge resends the\nmessage, then if it has already been received by the target server, it\nwill be ignored.\nTo configure a core bridge to add the duplicate id header, simply set\nthe use-duplicate-detection to true when configuring a bridge in\nbroker.xml.\nThe default value for this parameter is true.\nFor more information on core bridges and how to configure them, please\nsee Core Bridges.\nDuplicate Detection and Cluster Connections\nCluster connections internally use core bridges to move messages\nreliable between nodes of the cluster. Consequently they can also be\nconfigured to insert the duplicate id header for each message they move\nusing their internal bridges.\nTo configure a cluster connection to add the duplicate id header, simply\nset the use-duplicate-detection to true when configuring a cluster\nconnection in broker.xml.\nThe default value for this parameter is true.\nFor more information on cluster connections and how to configure them,\nplease see Clusters.\n"},"clusters.html":{"url":"clusters.html","title":"Clusters","keywords":"","body":"Clusters\nOverview\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis clusters allow groups of Apache ActiveMQ Artemis servers to be grouped\ntogether in order to share message processing load. Each active node in\nthe cluster is an active Apache ActiveMQ Artemis server which manages its own messages\nand handles its own connections.\nThe cluster is formed by each node declaring cluster connections to\nother nodes in the core configuration file broker.xml.\nWhen a node forms a cluster connection to another node, internally it\ncreates a core bridge (as described in Core Bridges) connection between it and\nthe other node, this is done transparently behind the scenes - you don't\nhave to declare an explicit bridge for each node. These cluster\nconnections allow messages to flow between the nodes of the cluster to\nbalance load.\nNodes can be connected together to form a cluster in many different\ntopologies, we will discuss a couple of the more common topologies later\nin this chapter.\nWe'll also discuss client side load balancing, where we can balance\nclient connections across the nodes of the cluster, and we'll consider\nmessage redistribution where Apache ActiveMQ Artemis will redistribute messages between\nnodes to avoid starvation.\nAnother important part of clustering is server discovery where servers\ncan broadcast their connection details so clients or other servers can\nconnect to them with the minimum of configuration.\n\nWarning\nOnce a cluster node has been configured it is common to simply copy\nthat configuration to other nodes to produce a symmetric cluster.\nHowever, care must be taken when copying the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis files. Do not\ncopy the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis data (i.e. the bindings, journal, and\nlarge-messages directories) from one node to another. When a node is\nstarted for the first time and initializes its journal files it also\npersists a special identifier to the journal directory. This id\nmust be unique among nodes in the cluster or the cluster will not\nform properly.\n\nServer discovery\nServer discovery is a mechanism by which servers can propagate their\nconnection details to:\n\nMessaging clients. A messaging client wants to be able to connect to\nthe servers of the cluster without having specific knowledge of\nwhich servers in the cluster are up at any one time.\n\nOther servers. Servers in a cluster want to be able to create\ncluster connections to each other without having prior knowledge of\nall the other servers in the cluster.\n\n\nThis information, let's call it the Cluster Topology, is actually sent\naround normal Apache ActiveMQ Artemis connections to clients and to other servers over\ncluster connections. This being the case we need a way of establishing\nthe initial first connection. This can be done using dynamic discovery\ntechniques like\nUDP and\nJGroups, or by providing a list of initial\nconnectors.\nDynamic Discovery\nServer discovery uses\nUDP multicast or\nJGroups to broadcast server connection\nsettings.\nBroadcast Groups\nA broadcast group is the means by which a server broadcasts connectors\nover the network. A connector defines a way in which a client (or other\nserver) can make connections to the server. For more information on what\na connector is, please see Configuring the Transport.\nThe broadcast group takes a set of connector pairs, each connector pair\ncontains connection settings for a live and backup server (if one\nexists) and broadcasts them on the network. Depending on which\nbroadcasting technique you configure the cluster, it uses either UDP or\nJGroups to broadcast connector pairs information.\nBroadcast groups are defined in the server configuration file\nbroker.xml. There can be many broadcast groups per\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis server. All broadcast groups must be defined in a\nbroadcast-groups element.\nLet's take a look at an example broadcast group from\nbroker.xml that defines a UDP broadcast group:\n\n   \n    172.16.9.3\n    5432\n    231.7.7.7\n    9876\n    2000\n    netty-connector\n   \n\n\nSome of the broadcast group parameters are optional and you'll normally\nuse the defaults, but we specify them all in the above example for\nclarity. Let's discuss each one in turn:\n\nname attribute. Each broadcast group in the server must have a\nunique name.\n\nlocal-bind-address. This is the local bind address that the\ndatagram socket is bound to. If you have multiple network interfaces\non your server, you would specify which one you wish to use for\nbroadcasts by setting this property. If this property is not\nspecified then the socket will be bound to the wildcard address, an\nIP address chosen by the kernel. This is a UDP specific attribute.\n\nlocal-bind-port. If you want to specify a local port to which the\ndatagram socket is bound you can specify it here. Normally you would\njust use the default value of -1 which signifies that an anonymous\nport should be used. This parameter is always specified in\nconjunction with local-bind-address. This is a UDP specific\nattribute.\n\ngroup-address. This is the multicast address to which the data\nwill be broadcast. It is a class D IP address in the range\n224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255, inclusive. The address 224.0.0.0\nis reserved and is not available for use. This parameter is\nmandatory. This is a UDP specific attribute.\n\ngroup-port. This is the UDP port number used for broadcasting.\nThis parameter is mandatory. This is a UDP specific attribute.\n\nbroadcast-period. This is the period in milliseconds between\nconsecutive broadcasts. This parameter is optional, the default\nvalue is 2000 milliseconds.\n\nconnector-ref. This specifies the connector and optional backup\nconnector that will be broadcasted (see Configuring the Transport for more information on\nconnectors). \n\n\nHere is another example broadcast group that defines a JGroups broadcast\ngroup:\n\n   \n      test-jgroups-file_ping.xml\n      activemq_broadcast_channel\n      2000\n      netty-connector\n   \n\n\nTo be able to use JGroups to broadcast, one must specify two attributes,\ni.e. jgroups-file and jgroups-channel, as discussed in details as\nfollowing:\n\njgroups-file attribute. This is the name of JGroups configuration\nfile. It will be used to initialize JGroups channels. Make sure the\nfile is in the java resource path so that Apache ActiveMQ Artemis can load it.\n\njgroups-channel attribute. The name that JGroups channels connect\nto for broadcasting.\n\n\n\nNote:\nThe JGroups attributes (jgroups-file and jgroups-channel) and UDP\nspecific attributes described above are exclusive of each other. Only\none set can be specified in a broadcast group configuration. Don't mix\nthem!\n\nThe following is an example of a JGroups file\n\n   \n\n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n\n\nAs it shows, the file content defines a jgroups protocol stacks. If you\nwant Apache ActiveMQ Artemis to use this stacks for channel creation, you have to make\nsure the value of jgroups-file in your broadcast-group/discovery-group\nconfiguration to be the name of this jgroups configuration file. For\nexample if the above stacks configuration is stored in a file named\n\"jgroups-stacks.xml\" then your jgroups-file should be like\njgroups-stacks.xml\n\nDiscovery Groups\nWhile the broadcast group defines how connector information is\nbroadcasted from a server, a discovery group defines how connector\ninformation is received from a broadcast endpoint (a UDP multicast\naddress or JGroup channel).\nA discovery group maintains a list of connector pairs - one for each\nbroadcast by a different server. As it receives broadcasts on the\nbroadcast endpoint from a particular server it updates its entry in the\nlist for that server.\nIf it has not received a broadcast from a particular server for a length\nof time it will remove that server's entry from its list.\nDiscovery groups are used in two places in Apache ActiveMQ Artemis:\n\nBy cluster connections so they know how to obtain an initial\nconnection to download the topology\n\nBy messaging clients so they know how to obtain an initial\nconnection to download the topology\n\n\nAlthough a discovery group will always accept broadcasts, its current\nlist of available live and backup servers is only ever used when an\ninitial connection is made, from then server discovery is done over the\nnormal Apache ActiveMQ Artemis connections.\n\nNote:\nEach discovery group must be configured with broadcast endpoint (UDP\nor JGroups) that matches its broadcast group counterpart. For example,\nif broadcast is configured using UDP, the discovery group must also\nuse UDP, and the same multicast address.\n\nDefining Discovery Groups on the Server\nFor cluster connections, discovery groups are defined in the server side\nconfiguration file broker.xml. All discovery groups\nmust be defined inside a discovery-groups element. There can be many\ndiscovery groups defined by Apache ActiveMQ Artemis server. Let's look at an example:\n\n   \n      172.16.9.7\n      231.7.7.7\n      9876\n      10000\n   \n\n\nWe'll consider each parameter of the discovery group:\n\nname attribute. Each discovery group must have a unique name per\nserver.\n\nlocal-bind-address. If you are running with multiple network\ninterfaces on the same machine, you may want to specify that the\ndiscovery group listens only only a specific interface. To do this\nyou can specify the interface address with this parameter. This\nparameter is optional. This is a UDP specific attribute.\n\ngroup-address. This is the multicast IP address of the group to\nlisten on. It should match the group-address in the broadcast\ngroup that you wish to listen from. This parameter is mandatory.\nThis is a UDP specific attribute.\n\ngroup-port. This is the UDP port of the multicast group. It should\nmatch the group-port in the broadcast group that you wish to\nlisten from. This parameter is mandatory. This is a UDP specific\nattribute.\n\nrefresh-timeout. This is the period the discovery group waits\nafter receiving the last broadcast from a particular server before\nremoving that servers connector pair entry from its list. You would\nnormally set this to a value significantly higher than the\nbroadcast-period on the broadcast group otherwise servers might\nintermittently disappear from the list even though they are still\nbroadcasting due to slight differences in timing. This parameter is\noptional, the default value is 10000 milliseconds (10 seconds).\n\n\nHere is another example that defines a JGroups discovery group:\n\n   \n      test-jgroups-file_ping.xml\n      activemq_broadcast_channel\n      10000\n   \n\n\nTo receive broadcast from JGroups channels, one must specify two\nattributes, jgroups-file and jgroups-channel, as discussed in\ndetails as following:\n\njgroups-file attribute. This is the name of JGroups configuration\nfile. It will be used to initialize JGroups channels. Make sure the\nfile is in the java resource path so that Apache ActiveMQ Artemis can load it.\n\njgroups-channel attribute. The name that JGroups channels connect\nto for receiving broadcasts.\n\n\n\nNote:\nThe JGroups attributes (jgroups-file and jgroups-channel) and UDP\nspecific attributes described above are exclusive of each other. Only\none set can be specified in a discovery group configuration. Don't mix\nthem!\n\nDiscovery Groups on the Client Side\nLet's discuss how to configure an Apache ActiveMQ Artemis client to use discovery to\ndiscover a list of servers to which it can connect. The way to do this\ndiffers depending on whether you're using JMS or the core API.\nConfiguring client discovery\nUse the udp URL scheme and a host:port combination matches the group-address and\ngroup-port from the corresponding broadcast-group on the server:\nudp://231.7.7.7:9876\nThe element discovery-group-ref specifies the name of a discovery\ngroup defined in broker.xml.\nConnections created using this URI will be load-balanced across the\nlist of servers that the discovery group maintains by listening on\nthe multicast address specified in the discovery group configuration.\nThe aforementioned refreshTimeout parameter can be set directly in the URI.\nThere is also a URL parameter named initialWaitTimeout. If the corresponding\nJMS connection factory or core session factory is used immediately after\ncreation then it may not have had enough time to received broadcasts from\nall the nodes in the cluster. On first usage, the connection factory will\nmake sure it waits this long since creation before creating the first\nconnection. The default value for this parameter is 10000 milliseconds.\nDiscovery using static Connectors\nSometimes it may be impossible to use UDP on the network you are using.\nIn this case its possible to configure a connection with an initial list\nof possible servers. This could be just one server that you know will\nalways be available or a list of servers where at least one will be\navailable.\nThis doesn't mean that you have to know where all your servers are going\nto be hosted, you can configure these servers to use the reliable\nservers to connect to. Once they are connected their connection details\nwill be propagated via the server it connects to\nConfiguring a Cluster Connection\nFor cluster connections there is no extra configuration needed, you just\nneed to make sure that any connectors are defined in the usual manner,\n(see Configuring the Transport for more information on connectors). These are then referenced by\nthe cluster connection configuration.\nConfiguring a Client Connection\nA static list of possible servers can also be used by a normal client.\nConfiguring client discovery\nA list of servers to be used for the initial connection attempt can be\nspecified in the connection URI using a syntax with (), e.g.:\n(tcp://myhost:61616,tcp://myhost2:61616)?reconnectAttempts=5\nThe brackets are expanded so the same query can be appended after the last\nbracket for ease.\nServer-Side Message Load Balancing\nIf cluster connections are defined between nodes of a cluster, then\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis will load balance messages arriving at a particular node from a\nclient.\nLet's take a simple example of a cluster of four nodes A, B, C, and D\narranged in a symmetric cluster (described in Symmetrical Clusters section). We have a queue\ncalled OrderQueue deployed on each node of the cluster.\nWe have client Ca connected to node A, sending orders to the server. We\nhave also have order processor clients Pa, Pb, Pc, and Pd connected to\neach of the nodes A, B, C, D. If no cluster connection was defined on\nnode A, then as order messages arrive on node A they will all end up in\nthe OrderQueue on node A, so will only get consumed by the order\nprocessor client attached to node A, Pa.\nIf we define a cluster connection on node A, then as ordered messages\narrive on node A instead of all of them going into the local\nOrderQueue instance, they are distributed in a round-robin fashion\nbetween all the nodes of the cluster. The messages are forwarded from\nthe receiving node to other nodes of the cluster. This is all done on\nthe server side, the client maintains a single connection to node A.\nFor example, messages arriving on node A might be distributed in the\nfollowing order between the nodes: B, D, C, A, B, D, C, A, B, D. The\nexact order depends on the order the nodes started up, but the algorithm\nused is round robin.\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis cluster connections can be configured to always blindly load\nbalance messages in a round robin fashion irrespective of whether there\nare any matching consumers on other nodes, but they can be a bit\ncleverer than that and also be configured to only distribute to other\nnodes if they have matching consumers. We'll look at both these cases in\nturn with some examples, but first we'll discuss configuring cluster\nconnections in general.\nConfiguring Cluster Connections\nCluster connections group servers into clusters so that messages can be\nload balanced between the nodes of the cluster. Let's take a look at a\ntypical cluster connection. Cluster connections are always defined in\nbroker.xml inside a cluster-connection element.\nThere can be zero or more cluster connections defined per Apache ActiveMQ Artemis\nserver.\n\n   \n      \n      netty-connector\n      1000\n      5000\n      50000\n      5000\n      500\n      1.0\n      5000\n      -1\n      -1\n      true\n      ON_DEMAND\n      1\n      32000\n      30000\n      1000\n      2\n      \n   \n\n\nIn the above cluster connection all parameters have been explicitly\nspecified. The following shows all the available configuration options\n\naddress Each cluster connection only applies to addresses that\nmatch the specified address field. An address is matched on the\ncluster connection when it begins with the string specified in this\nfield. The address field on a cluster connection also supports comma\nseparated lists and an exclude syntax !. To prevent an address\nfrom being matched on this cluster connection, prepend a cluster\nconnection address string with !.\nIn the case shown above the cluster connection will load balance\nmessages sent to all addresses (since it's empty).\nThe address can be any value and you can have many cluster\nconnections with different values of address, simultaneously\nbalancing messages for those addresses, potentially to different\nclusters of servers. By having multiple cluster connections on\ndifferent addresses a single Apache ActiveMQ Artemis Server can effectively take\npart in multiple clusters simultaneously.\nBe careful not to have multiple cluster connections with overlapping\nvalues of address, e.g. \"europe\" and \"europe.news\" since this\ncould result in the same messages being distributed between more\nthan one cluster connection, possibly resulting in duplicate\ndeliveries.\nExamples:\n\n'eu'\nmatches all addresses starting with 'eu'\n'!eu'\nmatches all address except for those starting with 'eu'\n'eu.uk,eu.de'\nmatches all addresses starting with either 'eu.uk' or\n'eu.de'\n'eu,!eu.uk'\nmatches all addresses starting with 'eu' but not those\nstarting with 'eu.uk'\n\nNote::\n\nAddress exclusion will always takes precedence over address\ninclusion.\nAddress matching on cluster connections does not support\nwild-card matching.\n\n\nconnector-ref. This is the connector which will be sent to other\nnodes in the cluster so they have the correct cluster topology.\nThis parameter is mandatory.\n\ncheck-period. The period (in milliseconds) used to check if the\ncluster connection has failed to receive pings from another server.\nDefault is 30000.\n\nconnection-ttl. This is how long a cluster connection should stay\nalive if it stops receiving messages from a specific node in the\ncluster. Default is 60000.\n\nmin-large-message-size. If the message size (in bytes) is larger\nthan this value then it will be split into multiple segments when\nsent over the network to other cluster members. Default is 102400.\n\ncall-timeout. When a packet is sent via a cluster connection and\nis a blocking call, i.e. for acknowledgements, this is how long it\nwill wait (in milliseconds) for the reply before throwing an\nexception. Default is 30000.\n\nretry-interval. We mentioned before that, internally, cluster\nconnections cause bridges to be created between the nodes of the\ncluster. If the cluster connection is created and the target node\nhas not been started, or say, is being rebooted, then the cluster\nconnections from other nodes will retry connecting to the target\nuntil it comes back up, in the same way as a bridge does.\nThis parameter determines the interval in milliseconds between retry\nattempts. It has the same meaning as the retry-interval on a\nbridge (as described in Core Bridges).\nThis parameter is optional and its default value is 500\nmilliseconds.\n\nretry-interval-multiplier. This is a multiplier used to increase\nthe retry-interval after each reconnect attempt, default is 1.\n\nmax-retry-interval. The maximum delay (in milliseconds) for\nretries. Default is 2000.\n\ninitial-connect-attempts. The number of times the system will try\nto connect a node in the cluster initially. If the max-retry is\nachieved this node will be considered permanently down and the\nsystem will not route messages to this node. Default is -1 (infinite\nretries).\n\nreconnect-attempts. The number of times the system will try to\nreconnect to a node in the cluster. If the max-retry is achieved\nthis node will be considered permanently down and the system will\nstop routing messages to this node. Default is -1 (infinite\nretries).\n\nuse-duplicate-detection. Internally cluster connections use\nbridges to link the nodes, and bridges can be configured to add a\nduplicate id property in each message that is forwarded. If the\ntarget node of the bridge crashes and then recovers, messages might\nbe resent from the source node. By enabling duplicate detection any\nduplicate messages will be filtered out and ignored on receipt at\nthe target node.\nThis parameter has the same meaning as use-duplicate-detection on\na bridge. For more information on duplicate detection, please see Duplicate Detection.\nDefault is true.\n\nmessage-load-balancing. This parameter determines if/how\nmessages will be distributed between other nodes of the cluster.\nIt can be one of three values - OFF, STRICT, or ON_DEMAND \n(default). This parameter replaces the deprecated\nforward-when-no-consumers parameter.\nIf this is set to OFF then messages will never be forwarded to\nanother node in the cluster\nIf this is set to STRICT then each incoming message will be round\nrobin'd even though the same queues on the other nodes of the\ncluster may have no consumers at all, or they may have consumers\nthat have non matching message filters (selectors). Note that\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis will not forward messages to other nodes\nif there are no queues of the same name on the other nodes, even\nif this parameter is set to STRICT. Using STRICT is like setting\nthe legacy forward-when-no-consumers parameter to true.\nIf this is set to ON_DEMAND then Apache ActiveMQ Artemis will only\nforward messages to other nodes of the cluster if the address to which\nthey are being forwarded has queues which have consumers, and if those\nconsumers have message filters (selectors) at least one of those\nselectors must match the message. Using ON_DEMAND is like setting\nthe legacy forward-when-no-consumers parameter to false.\nKeep in mind that this message forwarding/balancing is what we call\n\"initial distribution.\" It is different than redistribution which\nis discussed below. This distinction is \nimportant because redistribution is configured differently and has \nunique semantics (e.g. it does not support filters (selectors)).\nDefault is ON_DEMAND.\n\nmax-hops. When a cluster connection decides the set of nodes to\nwhich it might load balance a message, those nodes do not have to be\ndirectly connected to it via a cluster connection. Apache ActiveMQ Artemis can be\nconfigured to also load balance messages to nodes which might be\nconnected to it only indirectly with other Apache ActiveMQ Artemis servers as\nintermediates in a chain.\nThis allows Apache ActiveMQ Artemis to be configured in more complex topologies and\nstill provide message load balancing. We'll discuss this more later\nin this chapter.\nThe default value for this parameter is 1, which means messages\nare only load balanced to other Apache ActiveMQ Artemis serves which are directly\nconnected to this server. This parameter is optional.\n\nconfirmation-window-size. The size (in bytes) of the window used\nfor sending confirmations from the server connected to. So once the\nserver has received confirmation-window-size bytes it notifies its\nclient, default is 1048576. A value of -1 means no window.\n\nproducer-window-size. The size for producer flow control over cluster connection.\n it's by default disabled through the cluster connection bridge but you may want\n to set a value if you are using really large messages in cluster. A value of -1 means no window.\n\ncall-failover-timeout. Similar to call-timeout but used when a\ncall is made during a failover attempt. Default is -1 (no timeout).\n\nnotification-interval. How often (in milliseconds) the cluster\nconnection should broadcast itself when attaching to the cluster.\nDefault is 1000.\n\nnotification-attempts. How many times the cluster connection\nshould broadcast itself when connecting to the cluster. Default is\n2.\n\ndiscovery-group-ref. This parameter determines which discovery\ngroup is used to obtain the list of other servers in the cluster\nthat this cluster connection will make connections to.\n\n\nAlternatively if you would like your cluster connections to use a static\nlist of servers for discovery then you can do it like this.\n\n   ...\n   \n      server0-connector\n      server1-connector\n   \n\n\nHere we have defined 2 servers that we know for sure will that at least\none will be available. There may be many more servers in the cluster but\nthese will; be discovered via one of these connectors once an initial\nconnection has been made.\nCluster User Credentials\nWhen creating connections between nodes of a cluster to form a cluster\nconnection, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis uses a cluster user and cluster password which is\ndefined in broker.xml:\nACTIVEMQ.CLUSTER.ADMIN.USER\nCHANGE ME!!\n\n\nWarning\nIt is imperative that these values are changed from their default, or\nremote clients will be able to make connections to the server using\nthe default values. If they are not changed from the default, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis\nwill detect this and pester you with a warning on every start-up.\n\nClient-Side Load balancing\nWith Apache ActiveMQ Artemis client-side load balancing, subsequent sessions created\nusing a single session factory can be connected to different nodes of\nthe cluster. This allows sessions to spread smoothly across the nodes of\na cluster and not be \"clumped\" on any particular node.\nThe load balancing policy to be used by the client factory is\nconfigurable. Apache ActiveMQ Artemis provides four out-of-the-box load balancing\npolicies, and you can also implement your own and use that.\nThe out-of-the-box policies are\n\nRound Robin. With this policy the first node is chosen randomly then\neach subsequent node is chosen sequentially in the same order.\nFor example nodes might be chosen in the order B, C, D, A, B, C, D,\nA, B or D, A, B, C, D, A, B, C, D or C, D, A, B, C, D, A, B, C.\nUse\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.api.core.client.loadbalance.RoundRobinConnectionLoadBalancingPolicy\nas the .\n\nRandom. With this policy each node is chosen randomly.\nUse\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.api.core.client.loadbalance.RandomConnectionLoadBalancingPolicy\nas the .\n\nRandom Sticky. With this policy the first node is chosen randomly\nand then re-used for subsequent connections.\nUse\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.api.core.client.loadbalance.RandomStickyConnectionLoadBalancingPolicy\nas the .\n\nFirst Element. With this policy the \"first\" (i.e. 0th) node is\nalways returned.\nUse\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.api.core.client.loadbalance.FirstElementConnectionLoadBalancingPolicy\nas the .\n\n\nYou can also implement your own policy by implementing the interface\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.api.core.client.loadbalance.ConnectionLoadBalancingPolicy\nSpecifying which load balancing policy to use differs whether you are\nusing JMS or the core API. If you don't specify a policy then the\ndefault will be used which is\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.api.core.client.loadbalance.RoundRobinConnectionLoadBalancingPolicy.\nThe parameter connectionLoadBalancingPolicyClassName can be set on the URI to\nconfigure what load balancing policy to use:\ntcp://localhost:61616?connectionLoadBalancingPolicyClassName=org.apache.activemq.artemis.api.core.client.loadbalance.RandomConnectionLoadBalancingPolicy\nThe set of servers over which the factory load balances can be\ndetermined in one of two ways:\n\nSpecifying servers explicitly in the URL. This also requires setting\nthe useTopologyForLoadBalancing parameter to false on the URL.\n\nUsing discovery. This is the default behavior.\n\n\nSpecifying Members of a Cluster Explicitly\nSometimes you want to explicitly define a cluster more explicitly, that\nis control which server connect to each other in the cluster. This is\ntypically used to form non symmetrical clusters such as chain cluster or\nring clusters. This can only be done using a static list of connectors\nand is configured as follows:\n\n   \n   netty-connector\n   500\n   true\n   STRICT\n   1\n   \n      server1-connector\n   \n\n\nIn this example we have set the attribute\nallow-direct-connections-only which means that the only server that\nthis server can create a cluster connection to is server1-connector.\nThis means you can explicitly create any cluster topology you want.\nMessage Redistribution\nAnother important part of clustering is message redistribution. Earlier\nwe learned how server side message load balancing round robins messages\nacross the cluster. If message-load-balancing is OFF or ON_DEMAND\nthen messages won't be forwarded to nodes which don't have matching\nconsumers. This is great and ensures that messages aren't moved to a\nqueue which has no consumers to consume them. However, there is a\nsituation it doesn't solve: What happens if the consumers on a queue\nclose after the messages have been sent to the node? If there are no\nconsumers on the queue the message won't get consumed and we have a\nstarvation situation.\nThis is where message redistribution comes in. With message\nredistribution Apache ActiveMQ Artemis can be configured to automatically\nredistribute messages from queues which have no consumers back to\nother nodes in the cluster which do have matching consumers. To enable\nthis functionality message-load-balancing must be ON_DEMAND.\nMessage redistribution can be configured to kick in immediately after\nthe last consumer on a queue is closed, or to wait a configurable delay\nafter the last consumer on a queue is closed before redistributing. By\ndefault message redistribution is disabled.\nMessage redistribution can be configured on a per address basis, by\nspecifying the redistribution delay in the address settings. For more\ninformation on configuring address settings, please see Configuring Addresses and Queues via Address Settings.\nHere's an address settings snippet from broker.xml\nshowing how message redistribution is enabled for a set of queues:\n\n   \n      0\n   \n\n\nThe above address-settings block would set a redistribution-delay of\n0 for any queue which is bound to any address. So the above would enable\ninstant (no delay) redistribution for all addresses.\nThe attribute match can be an exact match or it can be a string that\nconforms to the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis wildcard syntax (described in Wildcard Syntax).\nThe element redistribution-delay defines the delay in milliseconds\nafter the last consumer is closed on a queue before redistributing\nmessages from that queue to other nodes of the cluster which do have\nmatching consumers. A delay of zero means the messages will be\nimmediately redistributed. A value of -1 signifies that messages will\nnever be redistributed. The default value is -1.\nIt often makes sense to introduce a delay before redistributing as it's\na common case that a consumer closes but another one quickly is created\non the same queue, in such a case you probably don't want to\nredistribute immediately since the new consumer will arrive shortly.\nRedistribution and filters (selectors)\nAlthough \"initial distribution\" (described above) does support filters\n(selectors), redistribution does not support filters. Consider this\nscenario:\n\nA cluster of 2 nodes - A and B - using a redistribution-delay of\n0 and a message-load-balancing of ON_DEMAND.\nA and B each has the queue foo.\nA producer sends a message which is routed to queue foo on node A. \nThe message has property named myProperty with a value of 10.\nA consumer connects to queue foo on node A with the filter \nmyProperty=5. This filter doesn't match the message.\nA consumer connects to queue foo on node B with the filter \nmyProperty=10. This filter does match the message .\n\nDespite the fact that the filter of the consumer on queue foo on node B\nmatches the message, the message will not be redistributed from node A to\nnode B because a consumer for the queue exists on node A.\nNot supporting redistribution based on filters was an explicit design decision\nin order to avoid two main problems - queue scanning and unnecessary \nredistribution.\nFrom a performance perspective a consumer with a filter on a queue is already\ncostly due to the scanning that the broker must do on the queue to find \nmatching messages. In general, this is a bit of an anti-pattern as it turns\nthe broker into something akin to a database where you can \"select\" the data \nyou want using a filter. If brokers are configured in a cluster and a consumer \nwith a filter connects and no matches are found after scanning the local queue\nthen potentially every instance of that queue in the cluster would need to be \nscanned. This turns into a bit of a scalability nightmare with lots of consumers \n(especially short-lived consumers) with filters connecting & disconnecting \nfrequently. The time & computing resources used for queue scanning would go \nthrough the roof.\nIt is also possible to get into a pathological situation where short-lived \nconsumers with filters connect to nodes around the cluster and messages get \nredistributed back and forth between nodes without ever actually being consumed.\nOne common use-case for consumers with filters (selectors) on queues is\nrequest/reply using a correlation ID. Following the standard pattern can be\nproblematic in a cluster due to the lack of redistribution based on filters\nalready described. However, there is a simple way to ensure an application\nusing this request/reply pattern gets its reply even when using a correlation\nID filter in a cluster - create the consumer before the request is sent. This\nwill ensure that when the reply is sent it will be routed the proper cluster\nnode since \"initial distribution\" (described above) does support filters.\nFor example, in the scenario outlined above if steps 3 and 5 were switched\n(i.e. if the consumers were created before the message was sent) then the \nconsumer on node B would in fact receive the message.\nCluster topologies\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis clusters can be connected together in many different\ntopologies, let's consider the two most common ones here\nSymmetric cluster\nA symmetric cluster is probably the most common cluster topology.\nWith a symmetric cluster every node in the cluster is connected to every\nother node in the cluster. In other words every node in the cluster is\nno more than one hop away from every other node.\nTo form a symmetric cluster every node in the cluster defines a cluster\nconnection with the attribute max-hops set to 1. Typically the\ncluster connection will use server discovery in order to know what other\nservers in the cluster it should connect to, although it is possible to\nexplicitly define each target server too in the cluster connection if,\nfor example, UDP is not available on your network.\nWith a symmetric cluster each node knows about all the queues that exist\non all the other nodes and what consumers they have. With this knowledge\nit can determine how to load balance and redistribute messages around\nthe nodes.\nDon't forget this warning when creating a symmetric\ncluster.\nChain cluster\nWith a chain cluster, each node in the cluster is not connected to every\nnode in the cluster directly, instead the nodes form a chain with a node\non each end of the chain and all other nodes just connecting to the\nprevious and next nodes in the chain.\nAn example of this would be a three node chain consisting of nodes A, B\nand C. Node A is hosted in one network and has many producer clients\nconnected to it sending order messages. Due to corporate policy, the\norder consumer clients need to be hosted in a different network, and\nthat network is only accessible via a third network. In this setup node\nB acts as a mediator with no producers or consumers on it. Any messages\narriving on node A will be forwarded to node B, which will in turn\nforward them to node C where they can get consumed. Node A does not need\nto directly connect to C, but all the nodes can still act as a part of\nthe cluster.\nTo set up a cluster in this way, node A would define a cluster\nconnection that connects to node B, and node B would define a cluster\nconnection that connects to node C. In this case we only want cluster\nconnections in one direction since we're only moving messages from node\nA->B->C and never from C->B->A.\nFor this topology we would set max-hops to 2. With a value of 2\nthe knowledge of what queues and consumers that exist on node C would be\npropagated from node C to node B to node A. Node A would then know to\ndistribute messages to node B when they arrive, even though node B has\nno consumers itself, it would know that a further hop away is node C\nwhich does have consumers.\nScaling Down\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis supports scaling down a cluster with no message loss (even for\nnon-durable messages). This is especially useful in certain environments\n(e.g. the cloud) where the size of a cluster may change relatively\nfrequently. When scaling up a cluster (i.e. adding nodes) there is no\nrisk of message loss, but when scaling down a cluster (i.e. removing\nnodes) the messages on those nodes would be lost unless the broker sent\nthem to another node in the cluster. Apache ActiveMQ Artemis can be configured to do\njust that.\nThe simplest way to enable this behavior is to set scale-down to\ntrue. If the server is clustered and scale-down is true then when\nthe server is shutdown gracefully (i.e. stopped without crashing) it\nwill find another node in the cluster and send all of its messages\n(both durable and non-durable) to that node. The messages are processed\nin order and go to the back of the respective queues on the other node\n(just as if the messages were sent from an external client for the first\ntime).\nIf more control over where the messages go is required then specify\nscale-down-group-name. Messages will only be sent to another node in\nthe cluster that uses the same scale-down-group-name as the server\nbeing shutdown.\n\nWarning\nIf cluster nodes are grouped together with different\nscale-down-group-name values beware. If all the nodes in a single\ngroup are shut down then the messages from that node/group will be\nlost.\n\nIf the server is using multiple cluster-connection then use\nscale-down-clustername to identify the name of the\ncluster-connection which should be used for scaling down.\n"},"federation.html":{"url":"federation.html","title":"Federation","keywords":"","body":"Federation\nIntroduction\nFederation allows transmission of messages between brokers without requiring clustering. \nA federated address can replicate messages published from an upstream address to a local address. \nn.b. This is only supported with multicast addresses.\nA federated queue lets a local consumer receive messages from an upstream queue.\nA broker can contain federated and local-only components - you don't need to federate everything if you don't want to. \nBenefits\nWAN\nThe source and target servers do not have to be in the same cluster which makes\nfederation suitable for reliably sending messages from one cluster to another,\nfor instance across a WAN, between cloud regions or there internet and where the \nconnection may be unreliable.\nFederation has built in resilience to failure so if the target server\nconnection is lost, e.g. due to network failure, federation will retry\nconnecting to the target until it comes back online. When it comes back online\nit will resume operation as normal.\nLoose Coupling of Brokers\nFederation can transmit messages between brokers (or clusters) in different administrative domains:\n\nthey may have different configuration, users and setup;\nthey may run on different versions of ActiveMQ Artemis\n\nDynamic and Selective\nFederation is applied by policies, that match address and queue names, and then apply. \nThis means that federation can dynamically be applied as queues or addresses are added and removed, \nwithout needing to hard configure each and every one.\nLike wise policies are selective, in that they apply with multiple include and exclude matches.\nMutliple policies can applied directly to multiple upstreams, \nas well policies can be grouped into policy sets and then applied to upstreams to make managing easier.\nAddress Federation\nAddress federation is like full multicast over the connected brokers, in that every message sent to address on Broker-A will be delivered to every queue on that broker, but like wise will be delivered to Broker-B and all attached queues there.\n\nFigure 1. Address Federation\nFor further details please goto Address Federation.\nQueue Federation\nEffectively, all federated queues act as a single logical queue, with multiple receivers on multiple machines. \nSo federated queues can be used for load balancing. Typically if the brokers are in the same AZ you would look to cluster them, the advantage of queue federation is that it does not require clustering so is suitable for over WAN, cross-region, on-off prem.\n\nFigure 2.

It automatically creates a queue on the remote address for itself, \nto which then it consumes, copying to the local address, as though they were published directly to it. \nThe upstream brokers do not need to be reconfigured or the address, simply permissions to the address need to be \ngiven to the address for the downstream broker. Similarly the same applies for downstream configurations.\n\nFigure 1. Address Federation\nTopology Patterns\nSymmetric\n\nFigure 2. Address Federation - Symmetric\nAs seen above, a publisher and consumer are connected to each broker. \nQueues and thus consumers on those queues, can receive messages published by either publisher.\nIt is important in this setup to set max-hops=1 to so that messages are copied only one and avoid cyclic replication.\nIf max-hops is not configured correctly, consumers will get multiple copies of the same message.\nFull Mesh\n\nFigure 3. Address Federation - Full Mesh\nIf not already spotted, the setup is identical to symemtric but simply where all brokers are symmetrically federating each other, creating a full mesh.\nAs illustrated, a publisher and consumer are connected to each broker. \nQueues and thus consumers on those queues, can receive messages published by either publisher.\nAs with symmetric setup, it is important in this setup to set max-hops=1 to so that messages are copied only one and avoid cyclic replication.\nIf max-hops is not configured correctly, consumers will get multiple copies of the same message.\nRing\n\nFigure 4. Address Federation - Symmetric\nIn a ring of brokers each federated address is upstream to just one other in the ring. To avoid the cyclic issue, \nit is important to set max-hops to n - 1 where n is the number of nodes in the ring. \ne.g. in the example above property is set to 5 so that every address in the ring sees the message exactly once.\nWhilst this setup is cheap in regards to connections, it is brittle, in that if a single broker fails, the ring fails.\nFan out\n\nFigure 5. Address Federation - Fan Out\nOne master address (it would required no configuration) is linked to by a tree of downstream federated addresses, \nthe tree can extend to any depth, and can be extended to without needing to re-configure existing brokers. \nIn this case messages published to the master address can be received by any consumer connected to any broker in the tree.\nDivert Binding Support\nDivert binding support can be added as part of the address policy configuration. This will allow the federation to respond\nto divert bindings to create demand. For example, let's say there is one address called \"test.federation.source\" that is\nincluded as a match for the federated address and another address called \"test.federation.target\" that is not included. Normally\nwhen a queue is created on \"test.federation.target\" this would not cause a federated consumer to be created because the address\nis not part of the included matches. However, if we create a divert binding such that \"test.federation.source\" is the source address\nand \"test.federation.target\" is the forwarded address then demand will now be created. The source address still must be multicast\nbut the target address can be multicast or anycast.\nAn example use case for this might be a divert that redirects JMS topics (multicast addresses) to a JMS queue (anycast addresses) to\nallow for load balancing of the messages on a topic for legacy consumers not supporting JMS 2.0 and shared subscriptions.\nConfiguring Address Federation\nFederation is configured in broker.xml.\nSample Address Federation setup:\n\n    \n        \n           \n              eu-east-connector1\n              eu-east-connector1\n           \n           \n        \n        \n           \n              eu-west-connector1\n              eu-west-connector1\n           \n           \n        \n\n        \n           \n           \n           \n\n           \n        \n\n        \n           org.foo.NewsTransformer\n           \n           \n        \n    \n\nIn the above setup downstream broker eu-north-1 is configured to connect to two upstream brokers eu-east-1 and eu-east-2, the credentials used for both connections to both brokers in this sample are shared, you can set user and password at the upstream level should they be different per upstream.\nBoth upstreams are configured with the same address-policy news-address-federation, that is selecting addresses which match any of the include criteria, but will exclude anything that starts queue.news.sport.\nIt is important that federation name is globally unique.\nLet's take a look at all the address-policy parameters in turn, in order of priority.\n\nname attribute.

The number of hops that a message can have made for it to be federated, see Topology Patterns above for more details.\n\nauto-delete. For address federation, the downstream dynamically creates a durable queue on the upstream address. This is used to mark if the upstream queue should be deleted once downstream disconnects, \nand the delay and message count params have been met. This is useful if you want to automate the clean up, though you may wish to disable this if you want messages to queued for the downstream when disconnect no matter what.\n\nauto-delete-delay. The amount of time in milliseconds after the downstream broker has disconnected before the upstream queue can be eligable for auto-delete.\n\nauto-delete-message-count. The amount number messages in the upstream queue that the message count must be equal or below before the downstream broker has disconnected before the upstream queue can be eligable for auto-delete.\n\ntransformer-ref. The ref name for a transformer (see transformer config) that you may wish to configure to transform the message on federation transfer.\n\nenable-divert-bindings. Setting to true will enable divert bindings to be listened for demand. If there is a divert binding with an address that matches the included\naddresses for the stream, any queue bindings that match the forward address of the divert will create demand. Default is false\n\n\nnote address-policy's and queue-policy's are able to be defined in the same federation, and be linked to the same upstream.\nNow look at all the transformer parameters in turn, in order of priority:\n\nname attribute.

This is the name of a user-defined class which implements the\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.core.server.transformer.Transformer interface.\nIf this is specified then the transformer's transform() method will be\ninvoked with the message before it is transferred. This gives you the opportunity\nto transform the message's header or body before it is federated.\n\nproperty holds key, value pairs that can be used to configure the transformer.\n\n\nFinally look at upstream, this is what defines the upstream broker connection and the policies to use against it.\n\nname attribute. This must be a unique name in the server, and is used to ref the transformer in address-policy and queue-policy\n\nuser. This optional attribute determines the user name to use when creating\nthe upstream connection to the remote server.

It will retrieve messages from upstream queues in order to satisfy demand for messages from local consumers. \nThe upstream queues do not need to be reconfigured and they do not have to be on the same broker or in the same cluster.\nAll of the configuration needed to establish the upstream links and the federated queue is in the downstream broker.\nUse Cases\nThis is not an exhaustive list of what you can do with and the benefits of federated queues, but simply some ideas.\n\nHigher capacity \nBy having a \"logical\" queue distributed over many brokers. Each broker would declare a federated queue with all the other federated queues upstream. (The links would form a complete bi-directional graph on n queues.)\n\n\nBy having this a logical distributed queue is capable of having a much higher capacity than a single queue on a single broker. \nWhen will perform best when there is some degree of locality.\ne.g. as many messages as possible are consumed from the same broker as they were published to, where federation only needs to move messages around in order to perform load balancing.\n\n\nSupporting multi region or venue\nIn a multi region setup you may have producers in one region or venue and the consumer in another. \ntypically you want producers and consumer to keep their connections local to the region, in such as case you can deploy brokers in each region where producers and consumer are, and use federation to move messages over the WAN between regions.\n\n\n\n\nCommunication between the secure enterprise lan and the DMZ.\n Where a number of producer apps maybe in the DMZ and a number of consumer apps in the secure enterprise lan, it may not suitable to allow the producers to connect through to the broker in the secure enterprise lan. \n In this scenario you could deploy a broker in the DMZ where the producers publish to, and then have the broker in the enterprise lan connect out to the DMZ broker and federate the queues so that messages can traverse. \n This is similar to supporting multi region or venue.\n\n\n\nMigrating between two clusters. \n  Consumers and publishers can be moved in any order and the messages won't be duplicated (which is the case if you do exchange federation). Instead, messages are transferred to the new cluster when your consumers are there. \n  Here for such a migration with blue/green or canary moving a number of consumers on the same queue, you may want to set the priority-adjustment to 0, or even a positive value, so message would actively flow to the federated queue.\n\nConfiguring Queue Federation\nFederation is configured in broker.xml.\nSample Queue Federation setup:\n\n    \n        \n           \n              eu-east-connector1\n              eu-east-connector1\n           \n           \n        \n        \n           \n              eu-west-connector1\n              eu-west-connector1\n           \n           \n        \n\n        \n           \n           \n           \n\n           \n        \n\n        \n           org.foo.NewsTransformer\n           \n           \n        \n    \n\nIn the above setup downstream broker eu-north-1 is configured to connect to two upstream brokers eu-east-1 and eu-east-2, the credentials used for both connections to both brokers in this sample are shared, you can set user and password at the upstream level should they be different per upstream.\nBoth upstreams are configured with the same queue-policy news-queue-federation, that is selecting addresses which match any of the include criteria, but will exclude any queues that end with .local, keeping these as local queues only.\nIt is important that federation name is globally unique.\nLet's take a look at all the queue-policy parameters in turn, in order of priority.\n\nname attribute. All address-policies must have a unique name in the server.\n\ninclude the address-match pattern to whitelist addresses, multiple of these can be set. If none are set all addresses are matched.\n\nexclude the address-match pattern to blacklist addresses, multiple of these can be set.\n\npriority-adjustment when a consumer attaches its priority is used to make the upstream consumer, \nbut with an adjustment by default -1, so that local consumers get load balanced first over remote, this enables this to be configurable should it be wanted/needed. \n\ninclude-federated by default this is false, we dont federate a federated consumer, this is to avoid issue, where in symmetric or any closed loop setup you could end up when no \"real\" consumers attached with messages flowing round and round endlessly. \n  There is though a valid case that if you dont have a close loop setup e.g. three brokers in a chain (A->B->C) with producer at broker A and consumer at C, you would want broker B to re-federate the consumer onto A.\n\ntransformer-ref.

A backup\nserver is owned by only one live server. Backup servers are not\noperational until failover occurs, however 1 chosen backup, which will\nbe in passive mode, announces its status and waits to take over the live\nservers work\nBefore failover, only the live server is serving the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis clients\nwhile the backup servers remain passive or awaiting to become a backup\nserver. When a live server crashes or is brought down in the correct\nmode, the backup server currently in passive mode will become live and\nanother backup server will become passive. If a live server restarts\nafter a failover then it will have priority and be the next server to\nbecome live when the current live server goes down, if the current live\nserver is configured to allow automatic failback then it will detect the\nlive server coming back up and automatically stop.\nHA Policies\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis supports two different strategies for backing up a server\nshared store and replication. Which is configured via the\nha-policy configuration element.\n\n   \n\n\nor\n\n   \n\n\nAs well as these 2 strategies there is also a 3rd called live-only.\nThis of course means there will be no Backup Strategy and is the default\nif none is provided, however this is used to configure scale-down\nwhich we will cover in a later chapter.\n\nNote:\nThe ha-policy configurations replaces any current HA configuration\nin the root of the broker.xml configuration. All old\nconfiguration is now deprecated although best efforts will be made to\nhonour it if configured this way.\nNote:\nOnly persistent message data will survive failover. Any non persistent\nmessage data will not be available after failover.\n\nThe ha-policy type configures which strategy a cluster should use to\nprovide the backing up of a servers data. Within this configuration\nelement is configured how a server should behave within the cluster,\neither as a master (live), slave (backup) or colocated (both live and\nbackup). This would look something like:\n\n   \n      \n   \n\n\nor\n\n   \n      \n   \n\n\nor\n\n   \n      \n   \n\n\nData Replication\nWhen using replication, the live and the backup servers do not share the\nsame data directories, all data synchronization is done over the\nnetwork. Therefore all (persistent) data received by the live server\nwill be duplicated to the backup.\nNotice that upon start-up the backup server will first need to\nsynchronize all existing data from the live server before becoming\ncapable of replacing the live server should it fail. So unlike when\nusing shared storage, a replicating backup will not be a fully\noperational backup right after start-up, but only after it finishes\nsynchronizing the data with its live server. The time it will take for\nthis to happen will depend on the amount of data to be synchronized and\nthe connection speed.\n\nNote:\nIn general, synchronization occurs in parallel with current network traffic so\nthis won't cause any blocking on current clients. However, there is a critical\nmoment at the end of this process where the replicating server must complete\nthe synchronization and ensure the replica acknowledges this completion. This\nexchange between the replicating server and replica will block any journal\nrelated operations. The maximum length of time that this exchange will block\nis controlled by the initial-replication-sync-timeout configuration element.\n\nReplication will create a copy of the data at the backup. One issue to\nbe aware of is: in case of a successful fail-over, the backup's data\nwill be newer than the one at the live's storage. If you configure your\nlive server to perform a failback to live server when restarted, it will synchronize its data\nwith the backup's. If both servers are shutdown, the administrator will\nhave to determine which one has the latest data.\nThe replicating live and backup pair must be part of a cluster. The\nCluster Connection also defines how backup servers will find the remote\nlive servers to pair with. Refer to Clusters for details on how this is done,\nand how to configure a cluster connection. Notice that:\n\nBoth live and backup servers must be part of the same cluster.\nNotice that even a simple live/backup replicating pair will require\na cluster configuration.\n\nTheir cluster user and password must match.\n\n\nWithin a cluster, there are two ways that a backup server will locate a\nlive server to replicate from, these are:\n\nspecifying a node group. You can specify a group of live servers\nthat a backup server can connect to. This is done by configuring\ngroup-name in either the master or the slave element of the\nbroker.xml. A Backup server will only connect to a\nlive server that shares the same node group name\n\nconnecting to any live. This will be the behaviour if group-name\nis not configured allowing a backup server to connect to any live\nserver\n\n\n\nNote:\nA group-name example: suppose you have 5 live servers and 6 backup\nservers:\n\nlive1, live2, live3: with group-name=fish\n\nlive4, live5: with group-name=bird\n\nbackup1, backup2, backup3, backup4: with group-name=fish\n\nbackup5, backup6: with group-name=bird\n\n\nAfter joining the cluster the backups with group-name=fish will\nsearch for live servers with group-name=fish to pair with. Since\nthere is one backup too many, the fish will remain with one spare\nbackup.\nThe 2 backups with group-name=bird (backup5 and backup6) will\npair with live servers live4 and live5.\n\nThe backup will search for any live server that it is configured to\nconnect to. It then tries to replicate with each live server in turn\nuntil it finds a live server that has no current backup configured. If\nno live server is available it will wait until the cluster topology\nchanges and repeats the process.\n\nNote:\nThis is an important distinction from a shared-store backup, if a\nbackup starts and does not find a live server, the server will just\nactivate and start to serve client requests. In the replication case,\nthe backup just keeps waiting for a live server to pair with. Note\nthat in replication the backup server does not know whether any data\nit might have is up to date, so it really cannot decide to activate\nautomatically. To activate a replicating backup server using the data\nit has, the administrator must change its configuration to make it a\nlive server by changing slave to master.\n\nMuch like in the shared-store case, when the live server stops or\ncrashes, its replicating backup will become active and take over its\nduties. Specifically, the backup will become active when it loses\nconnection to its live server. This can be problematic because this can\nalso happen because of a temporary network problem. In order to address\nthis issue, the backup will try to determine whether it still can\nconnect to the other servers in the cluster. If it can connect to more\nthan half the servers, it will become active, if more than half the\nservers also disappeared with the live, the backup will wait and try\nreconnecting with the live. This avoids a split brain situation.\nConfiguration\nTo configure the live and backup servers to be a replicating pair,\nconfigure the live server in ' broker.xml to have:\n\n   \n      \n   \n\n...\n\n   \n      ...\n   \n\n\nThe backup server must be similarly configured but as a slave\n\n   \n      \n   \n\n\nAll Replication Configuration\nThe following table lists all the ha-policy configuration elements for\nHA strategy Replication for master:\n\ncheck-for-live-server\n\nWhether to check the cluster for a (live) server using our own server\nID when starting up. This is an important option to avoid split-brain\nwhen failover happens and the master is restarted. Default is false.\n\ncluster-name\n\nName of the cluster configuration to use for replication.

The use case is when the backup has failed\nover.\n\ninitial-replication-sync-timeout\n\nAfter failover and the slave has become live, this is set on the new\nlive server. It represents the amount of time the replicating server\nwill wait at the completion of the initial replication process for the\nreplica to acknowledge it has received all the necessary data. The\ndefault is 30,000 milliseconds. Note: during this interval any\njournal related operations will be blocked.\nShared Store\nWhen using a shared store, both live and backup servers share the same\nentire data directory using a shared file system. This means the paging\ndirectory, journal directory, large messages and binding journal.\nWhen failover occurs and a backup server takes over, it will load the\npersistent storage from the shared file system and clients can connect\nto it.\nThis style of high availability differs from data replication in that it\nrequires a shared file system which is accessible by both the live and\nbackup nodes. Typically this will be some kind of high performance\nStorage Area Network (SAN). We do not recommend you use Network Attached\nStorage (NAS), e.g. NFS mounts to store any shared journal (NFS is\nslow).\nThe advantage of shared-store high availability is that no replication\noccurs between the live and backup nodes, this means it does not suffer\nany performance penalties due to the overhead of replication during\nnormal operation.\nThe disadvantage of shared store replication is that it requires a\nshared file system, and when the backup server activates it needs to\nload the journal from the shared store which can take some time\ndepending on the amount of data in the store.\nIf you require the highest performance during normal operation, have\naccess to a fast SAN and live with a slightly slower failover (depending\non amount of data).\n\nConfiguration\nTo configure the live and backup servers to share their store, configure\nid via the ha-policy configuration in broker.xml:\n\n   \n      \n   \n\n...\n\n   \n      ...\n   \n\n\nThe backup server must also be configured as a backup.\n\n   \n      \n   \n\n\nIn order for live - backup groups to operate properly with a shared\nstore, both servers must have configured the location of journal\ndirectory to point to the same shared location (as explained in Configuring the message journal)\n\nNote:\ntodo write something about GFS\n\nAlso each node, live and backups, will need to have a cluster connection\ndefined even if not part of a cluster. The Cluster Connection info\ndefines how backup servers announce there presence to its live server or\nany other nodes in the cluster. Refer to Clusters for details on how this is\ndone.\nFailing Back to live Server\nAfter a live server has failed and a backup taken has taken over its\nduties, you may want to restart the live server and have clients fail\nback.\nIn case of \"shared disk\", simply restart the original live server and\nkill the new live server. You can do this by killing the process itself.\nAlternatively you can set allow-fail-back to true on the slave\nconfig which will force the backup that has become live to automatically\nstop. This configuration would look like:\n\n   \n      \n         true\n      \n   \n\n\nIn replication HA mode you need to set an extra property\ncheck-for-live-server to true in the master configuration. If set\nto true, during start-up a live server will first search the cluster for\nanother server using its nodeID. If it finds one, it will contact this\nserver and try to \"fail-back\". Since this is a remote replication\nscenario, the \"starting live\" will have to synchronize its data with the\nserver running with its ID, once they are in sync, it will request the\nother server (which it assumes it is a back that has assumed its duties)\nto shutdown for it to take over. This is necessary because otherwise the\nlive server has no means to know whether there was a fail-over or not,\nand if there was if the server that took its duties is still running or\nnot. To configure this option at your broker.xml\nconfiguration file as follows:\n\n   \n      \n         true\n      \n   \n\n\n\nWarning\nBe aware that if you restart a live server while after failover has\noccurred then check-for-live-server must be set to true. If not the live server\nwill restart and server the same messages that the backup has already\nhandled causing duplicates.\n\nIt is also possible, in the case of shared store, to cause failover to\noccur on normal server shutdown, to enable this set the following\nproperty to true in the ha-policy configuration on either the master\nor slave like so:\n\n   \n      \n         true\n      \n   \n\n\nBy default this is set to false, if by some chance you have set this to\nfalse but still want to stop the server normally and cause failover then\nyou can do this by using the management API as explained at Management\nYou can also force the running live server to shutdown when the old live\nserver comes back up allowing the original live server to take over\nautomatically by setting the following property in the\nbroker.xml configuration file as follows:\n\n   \n      \n         true\n      \n   \n\n\nAll Shared Store Configuration\nThe following table lists all the ha-policy configuration elements for\nHA strategy shared store for master:\n\nfailover-on-shutdown\nIf set to true then when this server is stopped normally the backup will become live assuming failover. If false then the backup server will remain passive. Note that if false you want failover to occur the you can use the the management API as explained at Management.\n\nwait-for-activation\nIf set to true then server startup will wait until it is activated. If set to false then server startup will be done in the background. Default is true.\n\n\nThe following table lists all the ha-policy configuration elements for\nHA strategy Shared Store for slave:\n\nfailover-on-shutdown\nIn the case of a backup that has become live. then when set to true then when this server is stopped normally the backup will become liveassuming failover. If false then the backup server will remain passive. Note that if false you want failover to occur the you can use the the management API as explained at Management.\n\nallow-failback\nWhether a server will automatically stop when another places a request to take over its place. The use case is when the backup has failed over.\n\n\nColocated Backup Servers\nIt is also possible when running standalone to colocate backup servers\nin the same JVM as another live server. Live Servers can be configured\nto request another live server in the cluster to start a backup server\nin the same JVM either using shared store or replication. The new backup\nserver will inherit its configuration from the live server creating it\napart from its name, which will be set to colocated_backup_n where n\nis the number of backups the server has created, and any directories and\nits Connectors and Acceptors which are discussed later on in this\nchapter. A live server can also be configured to allow requests from\nbackups and also how many backups a live server can start. this way you\ncan evenly distribute backups around the cluster. This is configured via\nthe ha-policy element in the broker.xml file like\nso:\n\n   \n      \n         true\n         1\n         -1\n         5000\n         \n         \n      \n   \n\n\nthe above example is configured to use replication, in this case the\nmaster and slave configurations must match those for normal\nreplication as in the previous chapter. shared-store is also supported\n\nConfiguring Connectors and Acceptors\nIf the HA Policy is colocated then connectors and acceptors will be\ninherited from the live server creating it and offset depending on the\nsetting of backup-port-offset configuration element. If this is set to\nsay 100 (which is the default) and a connector is using port 61616 then\nthis will be set to 61716 for the first server created, 61816 for the\nsecond, and so on.\n\nNote:\nfor INVM connectors and Acceptors the id will have\ncolocated_backup_n appended, where n is the backup server number.\n\nRemote Connectors\nIt may be that some of the Connectors configured are for external\nservers and hence should be excluded from the offset. for instance a\nconnector used by the cluster connection to do quorum voting for a\nreplicated backup server, these can be omitted from being offset by\nadding them to the ha-policy configuration like so:\n\n   \n      \n         \n            remote-connector\n         \n.........\n\n\nConfiguring Directories\nDirectories for the Journal, Large messages and Paging will be set\naccording to what the HA strategy is. If shared store the the requesting\nserver will notify the target server of which directories to use. If\nreplication is configured then directories will be inherited from the\ncreating server but have the new backups name appended.\nThe following table lists all the ha-policy configuration elements for colocated policy:\n\nrequest-backup\nIf true then the server will request a backup on another node\n\nbackup-request-retries\nHow many times the live server will try to request a backup, -1 means for ever.\n\nbackup-request-retry-interval\nHow long to wait for retries between attempts to request a backup server.\n\nmax-backups\nHow many backups a live server can create\n\nbackup-port-offset\nThe offset to use for the Connectors and Acceptors when creating a new backup server.\n\n\nScaling Down\nAn alternative to using Live/Backup groups is to configure scaledown.\nwhen configured for scale down a server can copy all its messages and\ntransaction state to another live server. The advantage of this is that\nyou dont need full backups to provide some form of HA, however there are\ndisadvantages with this approach the first being that it only deals with\na server being stopped and not a server crash. The caveat here is if you\nconfigure a backup to scale down.\nAnother disadvantage is that it is possible to lose message ordering.\nThis happens in the following scenario, say you have 2 live servers and\nmessages are distributed evenly between the servers from a single\nproducer, if one of the servers scales down then the messages sent back\nto the other server will be in the queue after the ones already there,\nso server 1 could have messages 1,3,5,7,9 and server 2 would have\n2,4,6,8,10, if server 2 scales down the order in server 1 would be\n1,3,5,7,9,2,4,6,8,10.\n\nThe configuration for a live server to scale down would be something\nlike:\n\n   \n      \n         \n            server1-connector\n         \n      \n   \n\n\nIn this instance the server is configured to use a specific connector to\nscale down, if a connector is not specified then the first INVM\nconnector is chosen, this is to make scale down fromm a backup server\neasy to configure. It is also possible to use discovery to scale down,\nthis would look like:\n\n   \n      \n         \n      \n   \n\n\nScale Down with groups\nIt is also possible to configure servers to only scale down to servers\nthat belong in the same group. This is done by configuring the group\nlike so:\n\n   \n      \n         ...\n         my-group\n      \n   \n\n\nIn this scenario only servers that belong to the group my-group will\nbe scaled down to\nScale Down and Backups\nIt is also possible to mix scale down with HA via backup servers. If a\nslave is configured to scale down then after failover has occurred,\ninstead of starting fully the backup server will immediately scale down\nto another live server. The most appropriate configuration for this is\nusing the colocated approach. it means as you bring up live server\nthey will automatically be backed up by server and as live servers are\nshutdown, there messages are made available on another live server. A\ntypical configuration would look like:\n\n   \n      \n         44\n         33\n         3\n         false\n         33\n         \n            purple\n            true\n            abcdefg\n         \n         \n            tiddles\n            22\n            33rrrrr\n            false\n            \n               \n               boo!\n               \n               \n            \n         \n      \n   \n\n\nScale Down and Clients\nWhen a server is stopping and preparing to scale down it will send a\nmessage to all its clients informing them which server it is scaling\ndown to before disconnecting them. At this point the client will\nreconnect however this will only succeed once the server has completed\nscaledown. This is to ensure that any state such as queues or\ntransactions are there for the client when it reconnects. The normal\nreconnect settings apply when the client is reconnecting so these should\nbe high enough to deal with the time needed to scale down.\nFailover Modes\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis defines two types of client failover:\n\nAutomatic client failover\n\nApplication-level client failover\n\n\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis also provides 100% transparent automatic reattachment of\nconnections to the same server (e.g. in case of transient network\nproblems). This is similar to failover, except it is reconnecting to the\nsame server and is discussed in Client Reconnection and Session Reattachment\nDuring failover, if the client has consumers on any non persistent or\ntemporary queues, those queues will be automatically recreated during\nfailover on the backup node, since the backup node will not have any\nknowledge of non persistent queues.\nAutomatic Client Failover\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis clients can be configured to receive knowledge of all live and\nbackup servers, so that in event of connection failure at the client -\nlive server connection, the client will detect this and reconnect to the\nbackup server. The backup server will then automatically recreate any\nsessions and consumers that existed on each connection before failover,\nthus saving the user from having to hand-code manual reconnection logic.\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis clients detect connection failure when it has not received\npackets from the server within the time given by\nclient-failure-check-period as explained in section Detecting Dead Connections. If the client\ndoes not receive data in good time, it will assume the connection has\nfailed and attempt failover. Also if the socket is closed by the OS,\nusually if the server process is killed rather than the machine itself\ncrashing, then the client will failover straight away.\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis clients can be configured to discover the list of live-backup\nserver groups in a number of different ways. They can be configured\nexplicitly or probably the most common way of doing this is to use\nserver discovery for the client to automatically discover the list.\nFor full details on how to configure server discovery, please see Clusters.\nAlternatively, the clients can explicitly connect to a specific server\nand download the current servers and backups see Clusters.\nTo enable automatic client failover, the client must be configured to\nallow non-zero reconnection attempts (as explained in Client Reconnection and Session Reattachment).\nBy default failover will only occur after at least one connection has\nbeen made to the live server. In other words, by default, failover will\nnot occur if the client fails to make an initial connection to the live\nserver - in this case it will simply retry connecting to the live server\naccording to the reconnect-attempts property and fail after this number\nof attempts.\nFailing over on the Initial Connection\nSince the client does not learn about the full topology until after the\nfirst connection is made there is a window where it does not know about\nthe backup. If a failure happens at this point the client can only try\nreconnecting to the original live server. To configure how many attempts\nthe client will make you can set the URL parameter initialConnectAttempts.\nThe default for this is 0, that is try only once. Once the number of\nattempts has been made an exception will be thrown.\nFor examples of automatic failover with transacted and non-transacted\nJMS sessions, please see the examples chapter.\nA Note on Server Replication\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis does not replicate full server state between live and backup\nservers. When the new session is automatically recreated on the backup\nit won't have any knowledge of messages already sent or acknowledged in\nthat session. Any in-flight sends or acknowledgements at the time of\nfailover might also be lost.\nBy replicating full server state, theoretically we could provide a 100%\ntransparent seamless failover, which would avoid any lost messages or\nacknowledgements, however this comes at a great cost: replicating the\nfull server state (including the queues, session, etc.). This would\nrequire replication of the entire server state machine; every operation\non the live server would have to replicated on the replica server(s) in\nthe exact same global order to ensure a consistent replica state. This\nis extremely hard to do in a performant and scalable way, especially\nwhen one considers that multiple threads are changing the live server\nstate concurrently.\nIt is possible to provide full state machine replication using\ntechniques such as virtual synchrony, but this does not scale well and\neffectively serializes all operations to a single thread, dramatically\nreducing concurrency.\nOther techniques for multi-threaded active replication exist such as\nreplicating lock states or replicating thread scheduling but this is\nvery hard to achieve at a Java level.\nConsequently it has decided it was not worth massively reducing\nperformance and concurrency for the sake of 100% transparent failover.\nEven without 100% transparent failover, it is simple to guarantee once\nand only once delivery, even in the case of failure, by using a\ncombination of duplicate detection and retrying of transactions. However\nthis is not 100% transparent to the client code.\nHandling Blocking Calls During Failover\nIf the client code is in a blocking call to the server, waiting for a\nresponse to continue its execution, when failover occurs, the new\nsession will not have any knowledge of the call that was in progress.\nThis call might otherwise hang for ever, waiting for a response that\nwill never come.\nTo prevent this, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis will unblock any blocking calls that were in\nprogress at the time of failover by making them throw a\njavax.jms.JMSException (if using JMS), or a ActiveMQException with\nerror code ActiveMQException.UNBLOCKED. It is up to the client code to\ncatch this exception and retry any operations if desired.\nIf the method being unblocked is a call to commit(), or prepare(), then\nthe transaction will be automatically rolled back and Apache ActiveMQ Artemis will\nthrow a javax.jms.TransactionRolledBackException (if using JMS), or a\nActiveMQException with error code\nActiveMQException.TRANSACTION_ROLLED_BACK if using the core API.\nHandling Failover With Transactions\nIf the session is transactional and messages have already been sent or\nacknowledged in the current transaction, then the server cannot be sure\nthat messages sent or acknowledgements have not been lost during the\nfailover.\nConsequently the transaction will be marked as rollback-only, and any\nsubsequent attempt to commit it will throw a\njavax.jms.TransactionRolledBackException (if using JMS), or a\nActiveMQException with error code\nActiveMQException.TRANSACTION_ROLLED_BACK if using the core API.\n\nWarning\nThe caveat to this rule is when XA is used either via JMS or through\nthe core API. If 2 phase commit is used and prepare has already been\ncalled then rolling back could cause a HeuristicMixedException.\nBecause of this the commit will throw a XAException.XA_RETRY\nexception. This informs the Transaction Manager that it should retry\nthe commit at some later point in time, a side effect of this is that\nany non persistent messages will be lost. To avoid this use persistent\nmessages when using XA. With acknowledgements this is not an issue\nsince they are flushed to the server before prepare gets called.\n\nIt is up to the user to catch the exception, and perform any client side\nlocal rollback code as necessary. There is no need to manually rollback\nthe session - it is already rolled back. The user can then just retry\nthe transactional operations again on the same session.\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis ships with a fully functioning example demonstrating how to do\nthis, please see the examples chapter.\nIf failover occurs when a commit call is being executed, the server, as\npreviously described, will unblock the call to prevent a hang, since no\nresponse will come back. In this case it is not easy for the client to\ndetermine whether the transaction commit was actually processed on the\nlive server before failure occurred.\n\nNote:\nIf XA is being used either via JMS or through the core API then an\nXAException.XA_RETRY is thrown. This is to inform Transaction\nManagers that a retry should occur at some point. At some later point\nin time the Transaction Manager will retry the commit. If the original\ncommit has not occurred then it will still exist and be committed, if\nit does not exist then it is assumed to have been committed although\nthe transaction manager may log a warning.\n\nTo remedy this, the client can simply enable duplicate detection (Duplicate Message Detection) in\nthe transaction, and retry the transaction operations again after the\ncall is unblocked. If the transaction had indeed been committed on the\nlive server successfully before failover, then when the transaction is\nretried, duplicate detection will ensure that any durable messages\nresent in the transaction will be ignored on the server to prevent them\ngetting sent more than once.\n\nNote:\nBy catching the rollback exceptions and retrying, catching unblocked\ncalls and enabling duplicate detection, once and only once delivery\nguarantees for messages can be provided in the case of failure,\nguaranteeing 100% no loss or duplication of messages.\n\nHandling Failover With Non Transactional Sessions\nIf the session is non transactional, messages or acknowledgements can be\nlost in the event of failover.\nIf you wish to provide once and only once delivery guarantees for non\ntransacted sessions too, enabled duplicate detection, and catch unblock\nexceptions as described in Handling Blocking Calls During Failover\nGetting Notified of Connection Failure\nJMS provides a standard mechanism for getting notified asynchronously of\nconnection failure: java.jms.ExceptionListener. Please consult the JMS\njavadoc or any good JMS tutorial for more information on how to use\nthis.\nThe Apache ActiveMQ Artemis core API also provides a similar feature in the form of the\nclass org.apache.activemq.artemis.core.client.SessionFailureListener\nAny ExceptionListener or SessionFailureListener instance will always be\ncalled by ActiveMQ Artemis on event of connection failure, irrespective of\nwhether the connection was successfully failed over, reconnected or\nreattached, however you can find out if reconnect or reattach has\nhappened by either the failedOver flag passed in on the\nconnectionFailed on SessionfailureListener or by inspecting the\nerror code on the javax.jms.JMSException which will be one of the\nfollowing:\nJMSException error codes\n\nFAILOVER\nFailover has occurred and we have successfully reattached or reconnected.\n\nDISCONNECT\nNo failover has occurred and we are disconnected.\n\n\nApplication-Level Failover\nIn some cases you may not want automatic client failover, and prefer to\nhandle any connection failure yourself, and code your own manually\nreconnection logic in your own failure handler. We define this as\napplication-level failover, since the failover is handled at the user\napplication level.\nTo implement application-level failover, if you're using JMS then you\nneed to set an ExceptionListener class on the JMS connection. The\nExceptionListener will be called by Apache ActiveMQ Artemis in the event that\nconnection failure is detected. In your ExceptionListener, you would\nclose your old JMS connections, potentially look up new connection\nfactory instances from JNDI and creating new connections.\nFor a working example of application-level failover, please see the Application-Layer Failover Example.\nIf you are using the core API, then the procedure is very similar: you\nwould set a FailureListener on the core ClientSession instances.\n"},"graceful-shutdown.html":{"url":"graceful-shutdown.html","title":"Graceful Server Shutdown","keywords":"","body":"Graceful Server Shutdown\nIn certain circumstances an administrator might not want to disconnect all\nclients immediately when stopping the broker.

A Java scheduled thread pool\ncannot be configured to use a standard thread pool, otherwise we could\nuse a single thread pool for both scheduled and non scheduled activity.\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis will, by default, cap its thread pool\nat three times the number of cores (or hyper-threads) as reported by Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors() for processing\nincoming packets.

It maps internally to a\njava.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor instance.\nThe maximum number of thread used by this pool is configure in\nbroker.xml with the thread-pool-max-size parameter.\nIf a value of -1 is used this signifies that the thread pool has no\nupper bound and new threads will be created on demand if there are not\nenough threads available to satisfy a request. If activity later\nsubsides then threads are timed-out and closed.\nIf a value of n where nis a positive integer greater than zero is\nused this signifies that the thread pool is bounded. If more requests\ncome in and there are no free threads in the pool and the pool is full\nthen requests will block until a thread becomes available. It is\nrecommended that a bounded thread pool is used with caution since it can\nlead to dead-lock situations if the upper bound is chosen to be too low.\nThe default value for thread-pool-max-size is 30.\nSee the J2SE\njavadoc\nfor more information on unbounded (cached), and bounded (fixed) thread\npools.\nExpiry Reaper Thread\nA single thread is also used on the server side to scan for expired\nmessages in queues. We cannot use either of the thread pools for this\nsince this thread needs to run at its own configurable priority.\nFor more information on configuring the reaper, please see message expiry.\nAsynchronous IO\nAsynchronous IO has a thread pool for receiving and dispatching events\nout of the native layer. You will find it on a thread dump with the\nprefix ActiveMQ-AIO-poller-pool. Apache ActiveMQ Artemis uses one thread per opened\nfile on the journal (there is usually one).\nThere is also a single thread used to invoke writes on libaio. We do\nthat to avoid context switching on libaio that would cause performance\nissues. You will find this thread on a thread dump with the prefix\nActiveMQ-AIO-writer-pool.\nClient-Side Thread Management\nOn the client side, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis maintains a single, \"global\"\nstatic scheduled thread pool and a single, \"global\" static general thread\npool for use by all clients using the same classloader in that JVM instance.\nThe static scheduled thread pool has a maximum size of 5 threads by\ndefault.  This can be changed using the scheduledThreadPoolMaxSize URI\nparameter.\nThe general purpose thread pool has an unbounded maximum size. This is\nchanged using the threadPoolMaxSize URL parameter.\nIf required Apache ActiveMQ Artemis can also be configured so that each\nClientSessionFactory instance does not use these \"global\" static pools but\ninstead maintains its own scheduled and general purpose pool. Any\nsessions created from that ClientSessionFactory will use those pools\ninstead. This is configured using the useGlobalPools boolean URL parameter.\n"},"web-server.html":{"url":"web-server.html","title":"Embedded Web Server","keywords":"","body":"Embedded Web Server\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis embeds the Jetty web\nserver.

For\nexample, when you're trying to troublshoot an issue. Say you needed to get TRACE\nlogging from the logger org.foo. First you would need to add org.foo to the\nloggers list at the top of logging.properties, e.g.:\nloggers=...,org.foo\nThen you need to configure the logging level for the org.foo logger to TRACE,\ne.g.:\nlogger.org.foo.level=TRACE\nLastly, you would need to update the level of the necessary handler to allow\nthe TRACE logging through, e.g.:\nhandler.CONSOLE.level=TRACE\nor\nhandler.FILE.level=TRACE\nLogging in a client or with an Embedded server\nFirstly, if you want to enable logging on the client side you need to\ninclude the JBoss logging jars in your library.

This is configured by enabling a specific login module in the login config file. \norg.apache.activemq.artemis.spi.core.security.jaas.AuditLoginModule optional\n       debug=false;\n\n\nNote:\nThis needs to be the first entry in the login.config file\nNote:\nThis login module does no authentication, it is used only to catch client information through which ever path a client takes\n\nUse Custom Handlers\nTo use a different handler than the built-in ones, you either pick one from\nexisting libraries or you implement it yourself. All handlers must extends the\njava.util.logging.Handler class.\nTo enable a custom handler you need to append it to the handlers list\nlogger.handlers and add its configuration to the logging.configuration.\nLast but not least, once you get your own handler please add it to the boot\nclasspath otherwise the log\nmanager will fail to load it!\n"},"rest.html":{"url":"rest.html","title":"REST Interface","keywords":"","body":"REST Interface\nThe Apache ActiveMQ Artemis REST interface allows you to leverage the reliability and\nscalability features of Apache ActiveMQ Artemis over a simple REST/HTTP interface.\nThe REST Interface implementation sits on top of an Apache ActiveMQ Artemis JMS API and\nas such exposes JMS like concepts via REST.\nUsing the REST interface Messages can be produced and consumed by sending \nand receiving simple HTTP messages that contain the content you want to push around. For instance,\nhere's a simple example of posting an order to an order processing queue\nexpress as an HTTP message:\nPOST /queue/orders/create HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.com\nContent-Type: application/xml\n\n\n   Bill\n   iPhone 4\n   $199.99\n\nAs you can see, we're just posting some arbitrary XML document to a URL.\nWhen the XML is received on the server is it processed within Apache ActiveMQ Artemis\nas a JMS message and distributed through core Apache ActiveMQ Artemis. Simple and easy.\nConsuming messages from a queue or topic looks very similar. We'll\ndiscuss the entire interface in detail later.\nGoals of REST Interface\nWhy would you want to use Apache ActiveMQ Artemis's REST interface? What are the goals\nof the REST interface?\n\nEasily usable by machine-based (code) clients.\n\nZero client footprint. We want Apache ActiveMQ Artemis to be usable by any\nclient/programming language that has an adequate HTTP client\nlibrary. You shouldn't have to download, install, and configure a\nspecial library to interact with Apache ActiveMQ Artemis.\n\nLightweight interoperability. The HTTP protocol is strong enough to\nbe our message exchange protocol. Since interactions are RESTful the\nHTTP uniform interface provides all the interoperability you need to\ncommunicate between different languages, platforms, and even\nmessaging implementations that choose to implement the same RESTful\ninterface as Apache ActiveMQ Artemis (i.e. the REST-*\neffort.)\n\nNo envelope (e.g. SOAP) or feed (e.g. Atom) format requirements. You\nshouldn't have to learn, use, or parse a specific XML document\nformat in order to send and receive messages through Apache ActiveMQ Artemis's REST\ninterface.\n\nLeverage the reliability, scalability, and clustering features of\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis on the back end without sacrificing the simplicity of a\nREST interface.\n\n\nInstallation and Configuration\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis's REST interface is installed as a Web archive (WAR). It depends on the RESTEasy project and can currently only run within a servlet container. Installing the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis REST interface is a little bit different depending whether Apache ActiveMQ Artemis is already embedded (e.g. you're deploying within Wildfly) or configured on the network somewhere, or you want the ActiveMQ Artemis REST WAR itself to startup and manage the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis server.\nInstalling Within Pre-configured Environment\nThis section should be used when you want to use the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis REST interface in an environment that already has Apache ActiveMQ Artemis installed and running. You must create a Web archive (.WAR) file with the following web.xml settings:\n\n   \n      org.jboss.resteasy.plugins.server.servlet.ResteasyBootstrap\n   \n\n   \n      org.apache.activemq.artemis.rest.integration.RestMessagingBootstrapListener\n   \n\n   \n      Rest-Messaging\n      org.jboss.resteasy.plugins.server.servlet.FilterDispatcher\n   \n\n   \n      Rest-Messaging\n      /*\n   \n\n\nWithin your WEB-INF/lib directory you must have the artemis-rest.jar file. If RESTEasy is not installed within your environment, you must add the RESTEasy jar files within the lib directory as well. Here's a sample Maven pom.xml that can build a WAR with the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis REST library.\n\n\n   4.0.0\n   org.somebody\n   artemis-rest\n   war\n   My App\n   1.0-SNAPSHOT\n\n   \n      \n         org.apache.activemq.rest\n         artemis-rest\n         $VERSION\n         \n            \n               *\n               *\n            \n         \n      \n   \n\n\nThe project structure should look this like:\n|-- pom.xml\n`-- src\n   `-- main\n       `-- webapp\n           `-- WEB-INF\n               `-- web.xml\nIt is worth noting that when deploying a WAR in a Java EE application server like Wildfly the URL for the resulting application will include the name of the WAR by default. For example, if you've constructed a WAR as described above named \"activemq-rest.war\" then clients will access it at, e.g. http://localhost:8080/activemq-rest/[queues|topics]. We'll see more about this later.\nBootstrapping ActiveMQ Artemis Along with REST\nYou can bootstrap Apache ActiveMQ Artemis within your WAR as well. To do this, you must have the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis core and JMS jars along with Netty, RESTEasy, and the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis REST jar within your WEB-INF/lib. You must also have a broker.xml config file within WEB-INF/classes. The examples that come with the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis REST distribution show how to do this. You must also add an additional listener to your web.xml file. Here's an example:\n\n   \n      org.jboss.resteasy.plugins.server.servlet.ResteasyBootstrap\n   \n\n   \n      org.apache.activemq.artemis.rest.integration.ActiveMQBootstrapListener\n   \n\n   \n      org.apache.activemq.artemis.rest.integration.RestMessagingBootstrapListener\n   \n\n   \n      Rest-Messaging\n      org.jboss.resteasy.plugins.server.servlet.FilterDispatcher\n   \n\n   \n      Rest-Messaging\n      /*\n   \n\n\nHere's a Maven pom.xml file for creating a WAR for this environment. Make sure your Apache ActiveMQ Artemis configuration file(s) are within the src/main/resources directory so that they are stuffed within the WAR's WEB-INF/classes directory!\n\n\n   4.0.0\n   org.somebody\n   artemis-rest\n   war\n   My App\n   1.0-SNAPSHOT\n\n   \n      \n         org.apache.activemq.rest\n         artemis-rest\n         $VERSION\n      \n   \n\n\nThe project structure should look this like:\n|-- pom.xml\n`-- src\n   `-- main\n       `-- resources\n           `-- broker.xml\n       `-- webapp\n           `-- WEB-INF\n               `-- web.xml\nREST Configuration\nThe Apache ActiveMQ Artemis REST implementation does have some configuration options.\nThese are configured via XML configuration file that must be in your\nWEB-INF/classes directory. You must set the web.xml context-param\nrest.messaging.config.file to specify the name of the configuration\nfile. Below is the format of the XML configuration file and the default\nvalues for each.\n\n   0 \n   false\n   false\n   true\n   topic-push-store\n   queue-push-store\n   0\n   10\n   1\n   300\n   -1 \n   vm://0\n\n\nLet's give an explanation of each config option.\n\nserver-in-vm-id. The Apache ActiveMQ Artemis REST implementation was formerly hard-coded\nto use the in-vm transport to communicate with the embedded Apache ActiveMQ Artemis instance.\nThis is the id of the embedded instance. It is \"0\" by default. Note: this is deprecated in\nfavor of url which can be used to connect to an arbitrary instance of Apache ActiveMQ\nArtemis (including one over the network).\n\nuse-link-headers. By default, all links (URLs) are published using\ncustom headers. You can instead have the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis REST\nimplementation publish links using the Link Header\nspecification\ninstead if you desire.\n\ndefault-durable-send. Whether a posted message should be persisted\nby default if the user does not specify a durable query parameter.\n\ndups-ok. If this is true, no duplicate detection protocol will be\nenforced for message posting.\n\ntopic-push-store-dir. This must be a relative or absolute file\nsystem path. This is a directory where push registrations for topics\nare stored. See Pushing Messages.\n\nqueue-push-store-dir. This must be a relative or absolute file\nsystem path. This is a directory where push registrations for queues\nare stored. See Pushing Messages.\n\nproducer-session-pool-size. The REST implementation pools Apache ActiveMQ Artemis\nsessions for sending messages. This is the size of the pool. That\nnumber of sessions will be created at startup time.\n\nproducer-time-to-live. Default time to live for posted messages.\nDefault is no ttl.\n\nsession-timeout-task-interval. Pull consumers and pull\nsubscriptions can time out. This is the interval the thread that\nchecks for timed-out sessions will run at. A value of 1 means it\nwill run every 1 second.\n\nconsumer-session-timeout-seconds. Timeout in seconds for pull\nconsumers/subscriptions that remain idle for that amount of time.\n\nconsumer-window-size. For consumers, this config option is the\nsame as the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis one of the same name. It will be used by\nsessions created by the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis REST implementation.\nThis is deprecated in favor of url as it can be specified as a URL\nparameter.\n\nurl. The URL the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis REST implementation should use\nto connect to the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis instance. Default to \"vm://0\".\n\n\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis REST Interface Basics\nThe Apache ActiveMQ Artemis REST interface publishes a variety of REST resources to\nperform various tasks on a queue or topic. Only the top-level queue and\ntopic URI schemes are published to the outside world. You must discover\nall other resources to interact with by looking for and traversing links.\nYou'll find published links within custom response headers and embedded\nin published XML representations. Let's look at how this works.\nQueue and Topic Resources\nTo interact with a queue or topic you do a HEAD or GET request on the\nfollowing relative URI pattern:\n/queues/{name}\n/topics/{name}\nThe base of the URI is the base URL of the WAR you deployed the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis\nREST server within as defined in the Installation and\nConfiguration section of this document. Replace the {name}\nstring within the above URI pattern with the name of the queue or topic\nyou are interested in interacting with. Next, perform your HEAD or GET\nrequest on this URI. Here's what a request/response would look like.\nHEAD /queues/bar HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.com\n\n--- Response ---\nHTTP/1.1 200 Ok\nmsg-create: http://example.com/queues/bar/create\nmsg-create-with-id: http://example.com/queues/bar/create/{id}\nmsg-pull-consumers: http://example.com/queues/bar/pull-consumers\nmsg-push-consumers: http://example.com/queues/bar/push-consumers\n\nNote:\nYou can use the \"curl\" utility to test this easily. Simply execute a\ncommand like this:\n  curl --head http://example.com/queues/bar\n\nThe HEAD or GET response contains a number of custom response headers\nthat are URLs to additional REST resources that allow you to interact\nwith the queue or topic in different ways. It is important not to rely\non the scheme of the URLs returned within these headers as they are an\nimplementation detail. Treat them as opaque and query for them each and\nevery time you initially interact (at boot time) with the server. If you\ntreat all URLs as opaque then you will be isolated from implementation\nchanges as the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis REST interface evolves over time.\nQueue Resource Response Headers\nBelow is a list of response headers you should expect when interacting\nwith a Queue resource.\n\nmsg-create. This is a URL you POST messages to. The semantics of\nthis link are described in Posting Messages.\n\nmsg-create-with-id. This is a URL template you can use to POST\nmessages. The semantics of this link are described in Posting\nMessages.\n\nmsg-pull-consumers. This is a URL for creating consumers that will\npull from a queue. The semantics of this link are described in\nConsuming Messages via Pull.\n\nmsg-push-consumers. This is a URL for registering other URLs you\nwant the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis REST server to push messages to. The semantics of\nthis link are described in Pushing Messages.\n\n\nTopic Resource Response Headers\nBelow is a list of response headers you should expect when interacting\nwith a Topic resource.\n\nmsg-create. This is a URL you POST messages to. The semantics of\nthis link are described in Posting Messages.\n\nmsg-create-with-id. This is a URL template you can use to POST\nmessages. The semantics of this link are described in Posting\nMessages.\n\nmsg-pull-subscriptions. This is a URL for creating subscribers\nthat will pull from a topic. The semantics of this link are\ndescribed in Consuming Messages via Pull.\n\nmsg-push-subscriptions. This is a URL for registering other URLs\nyou want the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis REST server to push messages to. The semantics\nof this link are described in Pushing Messages.\n\n\nPosting Messages\nThis chapter discusses the protocol for posting messages to a queue or a\ntopic. In Apache ActiveMQ Artemis REST Interface Basics, you saw that a\nqueue or topic resource publishes variable custom headers that are links\nto other RESTful resources. The msg-create header is a URL you can\npost a message to. Messages are published to a queue or topic by sending\na simple HTTP message to the URL published by the msg-create header.\nThe HTTP message contains whatever content you want to publish to the\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis destination. Here's an example scenario:\n\nNote:\nYou can also post messages to the URL template found in\nmsg-create-with-id, but this is a more advanced use-case involving\nduplicate detection that we will discuss later in this section.\n\n\nObtain the starting msg-create header from the queue or topic\nresource.\nHEAD /queues/bar HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.com\n\n--- Response ---\nHTTP/1.1 200 Ok\nmsg-create: http://example.com/queues/bar/create\nmsg-create-with-id: http://example.com/queues/bar/create/{id}\n\nDo a POST to the URL contained in the msg-create header.\nPOST /queues/bar/create\nHost: example.com\nContent-Type: application/xml\n\n\n   Bill\n   iPhone4\n   $199.99\n\n\n--- Response ---\nHTTP/1.1 201 Created\nmsg-create-next: http://example.com/queues/bar/create\n\nNote:\nYou can use the \"curl\" utility to test this easily. Simply execute\na command like this:\ncurl --verbose --data \"123\" http://example.com/queues/bar/create\n\nA successful response will return a 201 response code. Also notice\nthat a msg-create-next response header is sent as well. You must\nuse this URL to POST your next message.\n\nPOST your next message to the queue using the URL returned in the\nmsg-create-next header.\nPOST /queues/bar/create\nHost: example.com\nContent-Type: application/xml\n\n\n   Monica\n   iPad\n   $499.99\n\n\n--- Response --\nHTTP/1.1 201 Created\nmsg-create-next: http://example.com/queues/bar/create\nContinue using the new msg-create-next header returned with each\nresponse.\n\n\n\nWarning\nIt is VERY IMPORTANT that you never re-use returned\nmsg-create-next headers to post new messages. If the dups-ok\nconfiguration property is set to false on the server then this URL\nwill be uniquely generated for each message and used for duplicate\ndetection. If you lose the URL within the msg-create-next header,\nthen just go back to the queue or topic resource to get the\nmsg-create URL again.\n\nDuplicate Detection\nSometimes you might have network problems when posting new messages to a\nqueue or topic. You may do a POST and never receive a response.\nUnfortunately, you don't know whether or not the server received the\nmessage and so a re-post of the message might cause duplicates to be\nposted to the queue or topic. By default, the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis REST interface is\nconfigured to accept and post duplicate messages. You can change this by\nturning on duplicate message detection by setting the dups-ok config\noption to false as described in Apache ActiveMQ Artemis REST Interface\nBasics. When you do this, the initial POST to the msg-create\nURL will redirect you, using the standard HTTP 307 redirection mechanism\nto a unique URL to POST to. All other interactions remain the same as\ndiscussed earlier. Here's an example:\n\nObtain the starting msg-create header from the queue or topic\nresource.\nHEAD /queues/bar HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.com\n\n--- Response ---\nHTTP/1.1 200 Ok\nmsg-create: http://example.com/queues/bar/create\nmsg-create-with-id: http://example.com/queues/bar/create/{id}\n\nDo a POST to the URL contained in the msg-create header.\nPOST /queues/bar/create\nHost: example.com\nContent-Type: application/xml\n\n\n   Bill\n   iPhone4\n   $199.99\n\n\n--- Response ---\nHTTP/1.1 307 Redirect\nLocation: http://example.com/queues/bar/create/13582001787372\nA successful response will return a 307 response code. This is\nstandard HTTP protocol. It is telling you that you must re-POST to\nthe URL contained within the Location header.\n\nre-POST your message to the URL provided within the Location\nheader.\nPOST /queues/bar/create/13582001787372\nHost: example.com\nContent-Type: application/xml\n\n\n   Bill\n   iPhone4\n   $199.99\n\n\n--- Response --\nHTTP/1.1 201 Created\nmsg-create-next: http://example.com/queues/bar/create/13582001787373\nYou should receive a 201 Created response. If there is a network\nfailure, just re-POST to the Location header. For new messages, use\nthe returned msg-create-next header returned with each response.\n\nPOST any new message to the returned msg-create-next header.\nPOST /queues/bar/create/13582001787373\nHost: example.com\nContent-Type: application/xml\n\n\n   Monica\n   iPad\n   $499.99\n\n\n--- Response --\nHTTP/1.1 201 Created\nmsg-create-next: http://example.com/queues/bar/create/13582001787374\nIf there ever is a network problem, just repost to the URL provided\nin the msg-create-next header.\n\n\nHow can this work? As you can see, with each successful response, the\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis REST server returns a uniquely generated URL within the\nmsg-create-next header. This URL is dedicated to the next new message\nyou want to post. Behind the scenes, the code extracts an identify from\nthe URL and uses Apache ActiveMQ Artemis's duplicate detection mechanism by setting the\nDUPLICATE_DETECTION_ID property of the JMS message that is actually\nposted to the system.\nIf you happen to use the same ID more than once you'll see a message\nlike this on the server:\nWARN  [org.apache.activemq.artemis.core.server] (Thread-3 (Apache ActiveMQ Artemis-remoting-threads-ActiveMQServerImpl::serverUUID=8d6be6f8-5e8b-11e2-80db-51bbde66f473-26319292-267207)) AMQ112098: Duplicate message detected - message will not be routed. Message information:\nServerMessage[messageID=20,priority=4, bodySize=1500,expiration=0, durable=true, address=bar,properties=TypedProperties[{http_content$type=application/x-www-form-urlencoded, http_content$length=3, postedAsHttpMessage=true, _AMQ_DUPL_ID=42}]]@12835058\nAn alternative to this approach is to use the msg-create-with-id\nheader. This is not an invokable URL, but a URL template. The idea is\nthat the client provides the DUPLICATE_DETECTION_ID and creates its\nown create-next URL. The msg-create-with-id header looks like this\n(you've see it in previous examples, but we haven't used it):\nmsg-create-with-id: http://example.com/queues/bar/create/{id}\nYou see that it is a regular URL appended with an {id}. This {id} is\na pattern matching substring. A client would generate its\nDUPLICATE_DETECTION_ID and replace {id} with that generated id, then\nPOST to the new URL. The URL the client creates works exactly like a\ncreate-next URL described earlier. The response of this POST would\nalso return a new msg-create-next header. The client can continue to\ngenerate its own DUPLICATE_DETECTION_ID, or use the new URL returned\nvia the msg-create-next header.\nThe advantage of this approach is that the client does not have to\nrepost the message. It also only has to come up with a unique\nDUPLICATE_DETECTION_ID once.\nPersistent Messages\nBy default, posted messages are not durable and will not be persisted in\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis's journal. You can create durable messages by modifying the\ndefault configuration as expressed in Chapter 2 so that all messages are\npersisted when sent. Alternatively, you can set a URL query parameter\ncalled durable to true when you post your messages to the URLs\nreturned in the msg-create, msg-create-with-id, or msg-create-next\nheaders. here's an example of that.\nPOST /queues/bar/create?durable=true\nHost: example.com\nContent-Type: application/xml\n\n\n   Bill\n   iPhone4\n   $199.99\n\nTTL, Expiration and Priority\nYou can set the time to live, expiration, and/or the priority of the\nmessage in the queue or topic by setting an additional query parameter.\nThe expiration query parameter is a long specifying the time in\nmilliseconds since epoch (a long date). The ttl query parameter is a\ntime in milliseconds you want the message active. The priority is\nanother query parameter with an integer value between 0 and 9 expressing\nthe priority of the message. i.e.:\nPOST /queues/bar/create?expiration=30000&priority=3\nHost: example.com\nContent-Type: application/xml\n\n\n   Bill\n   iPhone4\n   $199.99\n\nConsuming Messages via Pull\nThere are two different ways to consume messages from a topic or queue.\nYou can wait and have the messaging server push them to you, or you can\ncontinuously poll the server yourself to see if messages are available.\nThis chapter discusses the latter. Consuming messages via a pull works\nalmost identically for queues and topics with some minor, but important\ncaveats. To start consuming you must create a consumer resource on the\nserver that is dedicated to your client. Now, this pretty much breaks\nthe stateless principle of REST, but after much prototyping, this is the\nbest way to work most effectively with Apache ActiveMQ Artemis through a REST\ninterface.\nYou create consumer resources by doing a simple POST to the URL\npublished by the msg-pull-consumers response header if you are\ninteracting with a queue, the msg-pull-subscribers response header if\nyou're interacting with a topic. These headers are provided by the main\nqueue or topic resource discussed in Apache ActiveMQ Artemis REST Interface\nBasics. Doing an empty POST to one of these URLs will create a\nconsumer resource that follows an auto-acknowledge protocol and, if you\nare interacting with a topic, creates a temporarily subscription to the\ntopic. If you want to use the acknowledgement protocol and/or create a\ndurable subscription (topics only), then you must use the form\nparameters (application/x-www-form-urlencoded) described below.\n\nautoAck. A value of true or false can be given. This defaults\nto true if you do not pass this parameter.\n\ndurable. A value of true or false can be given. This defaults\nto false if you do not pass this parameter. Only available on\ntopics. This specifies whether you want a durable subscription or\nnot. A durable subscription persists through server restart.\n\nname. This is the name of the durable subscription. If you do not\nprovide this parameter, the name will be automatically generated by\nthe server. Only usable on topics.\n\nselector. This is an optional JMS selector string. The Apache ActiveMQ Artemis\nREST interface adds HTTP headers to the JMS message for REST\nproduced messages. HTTP headers are prefixed with \"http_\" and every\n'-' character is converted to a '$'.\n\nidle-timeout. For a topic subscription, idle time in milliseconds\nin which the consumer connections will be closed if idle.\n\ndelete-when-idle. Boolean value, If true, a topic subscription\nwill be deleted (even if it is durable) when the idle timeout is\nreached.\n\n\n\nNote:\nIf you have multiple pull-consumers active at the same time on the\nsame destination be aware that unless the consumer-window-size is 0\nthen one consumer might buffer messages while the other consumer gets\nnone.\n\nAuto-Acknowledge\nThis section focuses on the auto-acknowledge protocol for consuming\nmessages via a pull. Here's a list of the response headers and URLs\nyou'll be interested in.\n\nmsg-pull-consumers. The URL of a factory resource for creating\nqueue consumer resources. You will pull from these created\nresources.\n\nmsg-pull-subscriptions. The URL of a factory resource for creating\ntopic subscription resources. You will pull from the created\nresources.\n\nmsg-consume-next. The URL you will pull the next message from.\nThis is returned with every response.\n\nmsg-consumer. This is a URL pointing back to the consumer or\nsubscription resource created for the client.\n\n\nCreating an Auto-Ack Consumer or Subscription\nHere is an example of creating an auto-acknowledged queue pull consumer.\n\nFind the pull-consumers URL by doing a HEAD or GET request to the\nbase queue resource.\nHEAD /queues/bar HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.com\n\n--- Response ---\nHTTP/1.1 200 Ok\nmsg-create: http://example.com/queues/bar/create\nmsg-pull-consumers: http://example.com/queues/bar/pull-consumers\nmsg-push-consumers: http://example.com/queues/bar/push-consumers\n\nNext do an empty POST to the URL returned in the\nmsg-pull-consumers header.\nPOST /queues/bar/pull-consumers HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.com\n\n--- response ---\nHTTP/1.1 201 Created\nLocation: http://example.com/queues/bar/pull-consumers/auto-ack/333\nmsg-consume-next: http://example.com/queues/bar/pull-consumers/auto-ack/333/consume-next-1\nThe Location header points to the JMS consumer resource that was\ncreated on the server. It is good to remember this URL, although, as\nyou'll see later, it is transmitted with each response just to\nremind you.\n\n\nCreating an auto-acknowledged consumer for a topic is pretty much the\nsame. Here's an example of creating a durable auto-acknowledged topic\npull subscription.\n\nFind the pull-subscriptions URL by doing a HEAD or GET request to\nthe base topic resource\nHEAD /topics/bar HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.com\n\n--- Response ---\nHTTP/1.1 200 Ok\nmsg-create: http://example.com/topics/foo/create\nmsg-pull-subscriptions: http://example.com/topics/foo/pull-subscriptions\nmsg-push-subscriptions: http://example.com/topics/foo/push-subscriptions\n\nNext do a POST to the URL returned in the msg-pull-subscriptions\nheader passing in a true value for the durable form parameter.\nPOST /topics/foo/pull-subscriptions HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.com\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n\ndurable=true\n\n--- Response ---\nHTTP/1.1 201 Created\nLocation: http://example.com/topics/foo/pull-subscriptions/auto-ack/222\nmsg-consume-next:\nhttp://example.com/topics/foo/pull-subscriptions/auto-ack/222/consume-next-1\nThe Location header points to the JMS subscription resource that\nwas created on the server. It is good to remember this URL,\nalthough, as you'll see later, it is transmitted with each response\njust to remind you.\n\n\nConsuming Messages\nAfter you have created a consumer resource, you are ready to start\npulling messages from the server. Notice that when you created the\nconsumer for either the queue or topic, the response contained a\nmsg-consume-next response header. POST to the URL contained within\nthis header to consume the next message in the queue or topic\nsubscription. A successful POST causes the server to extract a message\nfrom the queue or topic subscription, acknowledge it, and return it to\nthe consuming client. If there are no messages in the queue or topic\nsubscription, a 503 (Service Unavailable) HTTP code is returned.\n\nWarning\nFor both successful and unsuccessful posts to the msg-consume-next\nURL, the response will contain a new msg-consume-next header. You must\nALWAYS use this new URL returned within the new msg-consume-next\nheader to consume new messages.\n\nHere's an example of pulling multiple messages from the consumer\nresource.\n\nDo a POST on the msg-consume-next URL that was returned with the\nconsumer or subscription resource discussed earlier.\nPOST /queues/bar/pull-consumers/consume-next-1\nHost: example.com\n\n--- Response ---\nHTTP/1.1 200 Ok\nContent-Type: application/xml\nmsg-consume-next: http://example.com/queues/bar/pull-consumers/333/consume-next-2\nmsg-consumer: http://example.com/queues/bar/pull-consumers/333\n\n...\nThe POST returns the message consumed from the queue. It also\nreturns a new msg-consume-next link. Use this new link to get the\nnext message. Notice also a msg-consumer response header is\nreturned. This is a URL that points back to the consumer or\nsubscription resource. You will need that to clean up your\nconnection after you are finished using the queue or topic.\n\nThe POST returns the message consumed from the queue. It also\nreturns a new msg-consume-next link. Use this new link to get the\nnext message.\nPOST /queues/bar/pull-consumers/consume-next-2\nHost: example.com\n\n--- Response ---\nHttp/1.1 503 Service Unavailable\nRetry-After: 5\nmsg-consume-next: http://example.com/queues/bar/pull-consumers/333/consume-next-2\nIn this case, there are no messages in the queue, so we get a 503\nresponse back. As per the HTTP 1.1 spec, a 503 response may return a\nRetry-After head specifying the time in seconds that you should\nretry a post. Also notice, that another new msg-consume-next URL is\npresent. Although it probably is the same URL you used last post,\nget in the habit of using URLs returned in response headers as\nfuture versions of Apache ActiveMQ Artemis REST might be redirecting you or adding\nadditional data to the URL after timeouts like this.\n\nPOST to the URL within the last msg-consume-next to get the next\nmessage.\nPOST /queues/bar/pull-consumers/consume-next-2\nHost: example.com\n\n--- Response ---\nHTTP/1.1 200 Ok\nContent-Type: application/xml\nmsg-consume-next: http://example.com/queues/bar/pull-consumers/333/consume-next-3\n\n...\n\n\nRecovering From Network Failures\nIf you experience a network failure and do not know if your post to a\nmsg-consume-next URL was successful or not, just re-do your POST. A POST\nto a msg-consume-next URL is idempotent, meaning that it will return the\nsame result if you execute on any one msg-consume-next URL more than\nonce. Behind the scenes, the consumer resource caches the last consumed\nmessage so that if there is a message failure and you do a re-post, the\ncached last message will be returned (along with a new msg-consume-next\nURL). This is the reason why the protocol always requires you to use the\nnext new msg-consume-next URL returned with each response. Information\nabout what state the client is in is embedded within the actual URL.\nRecovering From Client or Server Crashes\nIf the server crashes and you do a POST to the msg-consume-next URL, the\nserver will return a 412 (Preconditions Failed) response code. This is\ntelling you that the URL you are using is out of sync with the server.\nThe response will contain a new msg-consume-next header to invoke on.\nIf the client crashes there are multiple ways you can recover. If you\nhave remembered the last msg-consume-next link, you can just re-POST to\nit. If you have remembered the consumer resource URL, you can do a GET\nor HEAD request to obtain a new msg-consume-next URL. If you have\ncreated a topic subscription using the name parameter discussed earlier,\nyou can re-create the consumer. Re-creation will return a\nmsg-consume-next URL you can use. If you cannot do any of these things,\nyou will have to create a new consumer.\nThe problem with the auto-acknowledge protocol is that if the client or\nserver crashes, it is possible for you to skip messages. The scenario\nwould happen if the server crashes after auto-acknowledging a message\nand before the client receives the message. If you want more reliable\nmessaging, then you must use the acknowledgement protocol.\nManual Acknowledgement\nThe manual acknowledgement protocol is similar to the auto-ack protocol\nexcept there is an additional round trip to the server to tell it that\nyou have received the message and that the server can internally ack the\nmessage. Here is a list of the response headers you will be interested\nin.\n\nmsg-pull-consumers. The URL of a factory resource for creating\nqueue consumer resources. You will pull from these created resources\n\nmsg-pull-subscriptions. The URL of a factory resource for creating\ntopic subscription resources. You will pull from the created\nresources.\n\nmsg-acknowledge-next. URL used to obtain the next message in the\nqueue or topic subscription. It does not acknowledge the message\nthough.\n\nmsg-acknowledgement. URL used to acknowledge a message.\n\nmsg-consumer. This is a URL pointing back to the consumer or\nsubscription resource created for the client.\n\n\nCreating manually-acknowledged consumers or subscriptions\nHere is an example of creating an auto-acknowledged queue pull consumer.\n\nFind the pull-consumers URL by doing a HEAD or GET request to the\nbase queue resource.\nHEAD /queues/bar HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.com\n\n--- Response ---\nHTTP/1.1 200 Ok\nmsg-create: http://example.com/queues/bar/create\nmsg-pull-consumers: http://example.com/queues/bar/pull-consumers\nmsg-push-consumers: http://example.com/queues/bar/push-consumers\n\nNext do a POST to the URL returned in the msg-pull-consumers\nheader passing in a false value to the autoAck form parameter .\nPOST /queues/bar/pull-consumers HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.com\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n\nautoAck=false\n\n--- response ---\nHTTP/1.1 201 Created\nLocation: http://example.com/queues/bar/pull-consumers/acknowledged/333\nmsg-acknowledge-next: http://example.com/queues/bar/pull-consumers/acknowledged/333/acknowledge-next-1\nThe Location header points to the JMS consumer resource that was\ncreated on the server. It is good to remember this URL, although, as\nyou'll see later, it is transmitted with each response just to\nremind you.\n\n\nCreating a manually-acknowledged consumer for a topic is pretty much\nthe same. Here's an example of creating a durable manually-acknowledged\ntopic pull subscription.\n\nFind the pull-subscriptions URL by doing a HEAD or GET request to\nthe base topic resource\nHEAD /topics/bar HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.com\n\n--- Response ---\nHTTP/1.1 200 Ok\nmsg-create: http://example.com/topics/foo/create\nmsg-pull-subscriptions: http://example.com/topics/foo/pull-subscriptions\nmsg-push-subscriptions: http://example.com/topics/foo/push-subscriptions\n\nNext do a POST to the URL returned in the msg-pull-subscriptions\nheader passing in a true value for the durable form parameter\nand a false value to the autoAck form parameter.\nPOST /topics/foo/pull-subscriptions HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.com\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n\ndurable=true&autoAck=false\n\n--- Response ---\nHTTP/1.1 201 Created\nLocation: http://example.com/topics/foo/pull-subscriptions/acknowledged/222\nmsg-acknowledge-next:\nhttp://example.com/topics/foo/pull-subscriptions/acknowledged/222/consume-next-1\nThe Location header points to the JMS subscription resource that\nwas created on the server. It is good to remember this URL,\nalthough, as you'll see later, it is transmitted with each response\njust to remind you.\n\n\nConsuming and Acknowledging a Message\nAfter you have created a consumer resource, you are ready to start\npulling messages from the server. Notice that when you created the\nconsumer for either the queue or topic, the response contained a\nmsg-acknowledge-next response header. POST to the URL contained within\nthis header to consume the next message in the queue or topic\nsubscription. If there are no messages in the queue or topic\nsubscription, a 503 (Service Unavailable) HTTP code is returned. A\nsuccessful POST causes the server to extract a message from the queue or\ntopic subscription and return it to the consuming client. It does not\nacknowledge the message though. The response will contain the\nacknowledgement header which you will use to acknowledge the message.\nHere's an example of pulling multiple messages from the consumer\nresource.\n\nDo a POST on the msg-acknowledge-next URL that was returned with the\nconsumer or subscription resource discussed earlier.\nPOST /queues/bar/pull-consumers/consume-next-1\nHost: example.com\n\n--- Response ---\nHTTP/1.1 200 Ok\nContent-Type: application/xml\nmsg-acknowledgement:\nhttp://example.com/queues/bar/pull-consumers/333/acknowledgement/2\nmsg-consumer: http://example.com/queues/bar/pull-consumers/333\n\n...\nThe POST returns the message consumed from the queue. It also\nreturns amsg-acknowledgement link. You will use this new link to\nacknowledge the message. Notice also a msg-consumer response\nheader is returned. This is a URL that points back to the consumer\nor subscription resource. You will need that to clean up your\nconnection after you are finished using the queue or topic.\n\nAcknowledge or unacknowledge the message by doing a POST to the URL\ncontained in the msg-acknowledgement header. You must pass an\nacknowledge form parameter set to true or false depending on\nwhether you want to acknowledge or unacknowledge the message on the\nserver.\nPOST /queues/bar/pull-consumers/acknowledgement/2\nHost: example.com\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n\nacknowledge=true\n\n--- Response ---\nHttp/1.1 204 Ok\nmsg-acknowledge-next:\nhttp://example.com/queues/bar/pull-consumers/333/acknowledge-next-2\nWhether you acknowledge or unacknowledge the message, the response\nwill contain a new msg-acknowledge-next header that you must use to\nobtain the next message.\n\n\nRecovering From Network Failures\nIf you experience a network failure and do not know if your post to a\nmsg-acknowledge-next or msg-acknowledgement URL was successful or\nnot, just re-do your POST. A POST to one of these URLs is idempotent,\nmeaning that it will return the same result if you re-post. Behind the\nscenes, the consumer resource keeps track of its current state. If the\nlast action was a call tomsg-acknowledge-next, it will have the last\nmessage cached, so that if a re-post is done, it will return the message\nagain. Same goes with re-posting to msg-acknowledgement. The server\nremembers its last state and will return the same results. If you look\nat the URLs you'll see that they contain information about the expected\ncurrent state of the server. This is how the server knows what the\nclient is expecting.\nRecovering From Client or Server Crashes\nIf the server crashes and while you are doing a POST to the\nmsg-acknowledge-next URL, just re-post. Everything should reconnect\nall right. On the other hand, if the server crashes while you are doing\na POST tomsg-acknowledgement, the server will return a 412\n(Preconditions Failed) response code. This is telling you that the URL\nyou are using is out of sync with the server and the message you are\nacknowledging was probably re-enqueued. The response will contain a new\nmsg-acknowledge-next header to invoke on.\nAs long as you have \"bookmarked\" the consumer resource URL (returned\nfrom Location header on a create, or the msg-consumer header), you\ncan recover from client crashes by doing a GET or HEAD request on the\nconsumer resource to obtain what state you are in. If the consumer\nresource is expecting you to acknowledge a message, it will return a\nmsg-acknowledgement header in the response. If the consumer resource\nis expecting you to pull for the next message, the\nmsg-acknowledge-next header will be in the response. With manual\nacknowledgement you are pretty much guaranteed to avoid skipped\nmessages. For topic subscriptions that were created with a name\nparameter, you do not have to \"bookmark\" the returned URL. Instead, you\ncan re-create the consumer resource with the same exact name. The\nresponse will contain the same information as if you did a GET or HEAD\nrequest on the consumer resource.\nBlocking Pulls with Accept-Wait\nUnless your queue or topic has a high rate of message flowing though it,\nif you use the pull protocol, you're going to be receiving a lot of 503\nresponses as you continuously pull the server for new messages. To\nalleviate this problem, the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis REST interface provides the\nAccept-Wait header. This is a generic HTTP request header that is a\nhint to the server for how long the client is willing to wait for a\nresponse from the server. The value of this header is the time in\nseconds the client is willing to block for. You would send this request\nheader with your pull requests. Here's an example:\nPOST /queues/bar/pull-consumers/consume-next-2\nHost: example.com\nAccept-Wait: 30\n\n--- Response ---\nHTTP/1.1 200 Ok\nContent-Type: application/xml\nmsg-consume-next: http://example.com/queues/bar/pull-consumers/333/consume-next-3\n\n...\nIn this example, we're posting to a msg-consume-next URL and telling the\nserver that we would be willing to block for 30 seconds.\nClean Up Your Consumers!\nWhen the client is done with its consumer or topic subscription it\nshould do an HTTP DELETE call on the consumer URL passed back from the\nLocation header or the msg-consumer response header. The server will\ntime out a consumer with the value of consumer-session-timeout-seconds\nconfigured from REST configuration, so you don't have\nto clean up if you don't want to, but if you are a good kid, you will\nclean up your messes. A consumer timeout for durable subscriptions will\nnot delete the underlying durable JMS subscription though, only the\nserver-side consumer resource (and underlying JMS session).\nPushing Messages\nYou can configure the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis REST server to push messages to a\nregistered URL either remotely through the REST interface, or by\ncreating a pre-configured XML file for the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis REST server to load\nat boot time.\nThe Queue Push Subscription XML\nCreating a push consumer for a queue first involves creating a very\nsimple XML document. This document tells the server if the push\nsubscription should survive server reboots (is it durable). It must\nprovide a URL to ship the forwarded message to. Finally, you have to\nprovide authentication information if the final endpoint requires\nauthentication. Here's a simple example:\n\n   false\n    1\n   ]]>\n   \n   \n   5\n   1000\n   true\n\n\nThe durable element specifies whether the registration should be saved\nto disk so that if there is a server restart, the push subscription will\nstill work. This element is not required. If left out it defaults\ntofalse. If durable is set to true, an XML file for the push\nsubscription will be created within the directory specified by the\nqueue-push-store-dir config variable defined in Chapter 2\n(topic-push-store-dir for topics).\nThe selector element is optional and defines a JMS message selector.\nYou should enclose it within CDATA blocks as some of the selector\ncharacters are illegal XML.\nThe maxRetries element specifies how many times a the server will try\nto push a message to a URL if there is a connection failure.\nThe retryWaitMillis element specifies how long to wait before\nperforming a retry.\nThe disableOnFailure element, if set to true, will disable the\nregistration if all retries have failed. It will not disable the\nconnection on non-connection-failure issues (like a bad request for\ninstance). In these cases, the dead letter queue logic of Apache ActiveMQ Artemis will\ntake over.\nThe link element specifies the basis of the interaction. The href\nattribute contains the URL you want to interact with. It is the only\nrequired attribute. The type attribute specifies the content-type of\nwhat the push URL is expecting. The method attribute defines what HTTP\nmethod the server will use when it sends the message to the server. If\nit is not provided it defaults to POST. The rel attribute is very\nimportant and the value of it triggers different behavior. Here's the\nvalues a rel attribute can have:\n\ndestination. The href URL is assumed to be a queue or topic\nresource of another Apache ActiveMQ Artemis REST server. The push registration will\ninitially do a HEAD request to this URL to obtain a\nmsg-create-with-id header. It will use this header to push new\nmessages to the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis REST endpoint reliably. Here's an example:\n\n   \n\n\n\ntemplate. In this case, the server is expecting the link element's\nhref attribute to be a URL expression. The URL expression must have\none and only one URL parameter within it. The server will use a\nunique value to create the endpoint URL. Here's an example:\n\n   \n\nIn this example, the {id} sub-string is the one and only one URL\nparameter.\n\nuser defined. If the rel attributes is not destination or template\n(or is empty or missing), then the server will send an HTTP message\nto the href URL using the HTTP method defined in the method\nattribute. Here's an example:\n\n   \n\n\n\nThe Topic Push Subscription XML\nThe push XML for a topic is the same except the root element is\npush-topic-registration. (Also remember the selector element is\noptional). The rest of the document is the same. Here's an example of a\ntemplate registration:\n\n   true\n    1\n   ]]>\n   \n   \n\n\nCreating a Push Subscription at Runtime\nCreating a push subscription at runtime involves getting the factory\nresource URL from the msg-push-consumers header, if the destination is a\nqueue, or msg-push-subscriptions header, if the destination is a topic.\nHere's an example of creating a push registration for a queue:\n\nFirst do a HEAD request to the queue resource:\nHEAD /queues/bar HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.com\n\n--- Response ---\nHTTP/1.1 200 Ok\nmsg-create: http://example.com/queues/bar/create\nmsg-pull-consumers: http://example.com/queues/bar/pull-consumers\nmsg-push-consumers: http://example.com/queues/bar/push-consumers\n\nNext POST your subscription XML to the URL returned from\nmsg-push-consumers header\nPOST /queues/bar/push-consumers\nHost: example.com\nContent-Type: application/xml\n\n\n   \n\n\n--- Response ---\nHTTP/1.1 201 Created\nLocation: http://example.com/queues/bar/push-consumers/1-333-1212\nThe Location header contains the URL for the created resource. If\nyou want to unregister this, then do a HTTP DELETE on this URL.\n\n\nHere's an example of creating a push registration for a topic:\n\nFirst do a HEAD request to the topic resource:\nHEAD /topics/bar HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.com\n\n--- Response ---\nHTTP/1.1 200 Ok\nmsg-create: http://example.com/topics/bar/create\nmsg-pull-subscriptions: http://example.com/topics/bar/pull-subscriptions\nmsg-push-subscriptions: http://example.com/topics/bar/push-subscriptions\n\nNext POST your subscription XML to the URL returned from\nmsg-push-subscriptions header\nPOST /topics/bar/push-subscriptions\nHost: example.com\nContent-Type: application/xml\n\n\n   \n\n\n--- Response ---\nHTTP/1.1 201 Created\nLocation: http://example.com/topics/bar/push-subscriptions/1-333-1212\nThe Location header contains the URL for the created resource. If\nyou want to unregister this, then do a HTTP DELETE on this URL.\n\n\nCreating a Push Subscription by Hand\nYou can create a push XML file yourself if you do not want to go through\nthe REST interface to create a push subscription. There is some\nadditional information you need to provide though. First, in the root\nelement, you must define a unique id attribute. You must also define a\ndestination element to specify the queue you should register a consumer\nwith. For a topic, the destination element is the name of the\nsubscription that will be created. For a topic, you must also specify\nthe topic name within the topic element.\nHere's an example of a hand-created queue registration. This file must\ngo in the directory specified by the queue-push-store-dir config\nvariable defined in Chapter 2:\n\n   bar\n   true\n   \n\n\nHere's an example of a hand-created topic registration. This file must\ngo in the directory specified by the topic-push-store-dir config\nvariable defined in Chapter 2:\n\n   my-subscription-1true\n   \n   foo\n\n\nPushing to Authenticated Servers\nPush subscriptions only support BASIC and DIGEST authentication out of\nthe box. Here is an example of adding BASIC authentication:\n\n   true\n   \n   \n      \n         guest\n         geheim\n      \n   \n\n\nFor DIGEST, just replace basic-auth with digest-auth.\nFor other authentication mechanisms, you can register headers you want\ntransmitted with each request. Use the header element with the name\nattribute representing the name of the header. Here's what custom\nheaders might look like:\n\n   true\n   \n   jfdiwe3321\n\n\nCreating Destinations\nYou can create a durable queue or topic through the REST interface.\nCurrently you cannot create a temporary queue or topic. To create a\nqueue you do a POST to the relative URL /queues with an XML\nrepresentation of the queue. For example:\nPOST /queues\nHost: example.com\nContent-Type: application/activemq.xml\n\n\n   true\n\n\n--- Response ---\nHTTP/1.1 201 Created\nLocation: http://example.com/queues/testQueue\nNotice that the Content-Type is application/activemq.xml.\nHere's what creating a topic would look like:\nPOST /topics\nHost: example.com\nContent-Type: application/activemq.xml\n\n\n\n\n--- Response ---\nHTTP/1.1 201 Created\nLocation: http://example.com/topics/testTopic\nSecuring the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis REST Interface\nWithin Wildfly Application server\nSecuring the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis REST interface is very simple with the Wildfly\nApplication Server. You turn on authentication for all URLs within your\nWAR's web.xml, and let the user Principal to propagate to Apache ActiveMQ Artemis. This\nonly works if you are using the JAASSecurityManager with Apache ActiveMQ Artemis. See\nthe Apache ActiveMQ Artemis documentation for more details.\nSecurity in other environments\nTo secure the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis REST interface in other environments you must\nrole your own security by specifying security constraints with your\nweb.xml for every path of every queue and topic you have deployed. Here\nis a list of URI patterns:\n\n\n\nPost\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n/queues\nsecure the POST operation to secure queue creation\n\n\n/queues/{queue-name}/create/\nsecure this URL pattern for producing messages.\n\n\n/queues/{queue-name}/pull-consumers/\nsecure this URL pattern for pushing messages.\n\n\n/queues/{queue-name}/push-consumers/\nsecure the POST operation to secure topic creation\n\n\n/topics\nsecure the POST operation to secure topic creation\n\n\n/topics/{topic-name}\nsecure the GET HEAD operation to getting information about the topic.\n\n\n/topics/{topic-name}/create/\nsecure this URL pattern for producing messages\n\n\n/topics/{topic-name}/pull-subscriptions/\nsecure this URL pattern for pulling messages\n\n\n/topics/{topic-name}/push-subscriptions/\nsecure this URL pattern for pushing messages\n\n\n\nMixing JMS and REST\nThe Apache ActiveMQ Artemis REST interface supports mixing JMS and REST producers and\nconsumers. You can send an ObjectMessage through a JMS Producer, and\nhave a REST client consume it. You can have a REST client POST a message\nto a topic and have a JMS Consumer receive it. Some simple\ntransformations are supported if you have the correct RESTEasy providers\ninstalled.\nJMS Producers - REST Consumers\nIf you have a JMS producer, the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis REST interface only supports\nObjectMessage type. If the JMS producer is aware that there may be REST\nconsumers, it should set a JMS property to specify what Content-Type the\nJava object should be translated into by REST clients. The Apache ActiveMQ Artemis REST\nserver will use RESTEasy content handlers (MessageBodyReader/Writers) to\ntransform the Java object to the type desired. Here's an example of a\nJMS producer setting the content type of the message.\nObjectMessage message = session.createObjectMessage();\nmessage.setStringProperty(org.apache.activemq.rest.HttpHeaderProperty.CONTENT_TYPE, \"application/xml\");\n\nIf the JMS producer does not set the content-type, then this information\nmust be obtained from the REST consumer. If it is a pull consumer, then\nthe REST client should send an Accept header with the desired media\ntypes it wants to convert the Java object into. If the REST client is a\npush registration, then the type attribute of the link element of the\npush registration should be set to the desired type.\nREST Producers - JMS Consumers\nIf you have a REST client producing messages and a JMS consumer,\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis REST has a simple helper class for you to transform the HTTP\nbody to a Java object. Here's some example code:\npublic void onMessage(Message message) {\n   MyType obj = org.apache.activemq.rest.Jms.getEntity(message, MyType.class);\n}\n\nThe way the getEntity() method works is that if the message is an\nObjectMessage, it will try to extract the desired type from it like any\nother JMS message. If a REST producer sent the message, then the method\nuses RESTEasy to convert the HTTP body to the Java object you want. See\nthe Javadoc of this class for more helper methods.\n"},"embedding-activemq.html":{"url":"embedding-activemq.html","title":"Embedding the Broker","keywords":"","body":"Embedding Apache ActiveMQ Artemis\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis is designed as set of simple Plain Old Java Objects\n(POJOs). This means Apache ActiveMQ Artemis can be instantiated and run in any\ndependency injection framework such as Spring or Google Guice. It also means\nthat if you have an application that could use messaging functionality\ninternally then it can directly instantiate Apache ActiveMQ Artemis clients\nand servers in its own application code to perform that functionality. We call\nthis embedding Apache ActiveMQ Artemis.\nExamples of applications that might want to do this include any application\nthat needs very high performance, transactional, persistent messaging but\ndoesn't want the hassle of writing it all from scratch.\nEmbedding Apache ActiveMQ Artemis can be done in very few easy steps -\nsupply a broker.xml on the classpath or instantiate the configuration object,\ninstantiate the server, start it, and you have a Apache ActiveMQ Artemis running\nin your JVM. It's as simple and easy as that.\nEmbedding with XML configuration\nThe simplest way to embed Apache ActiveMQ Artemis is to use the embedded\nwrapper class and configure Apache ActiveMQ Artemis through broker.xml.\nHere's a simple example broker.xml:\n\n   \n\n      false\n\n      false\n\n      \n         vm://0\n      \n   \n\n\nimport org.apache.activemq.artemis.core.server.embedded.EmbeddedActiveMQ;\n\n...\n\nEmbeddedActiveMQ embedded = new EmbeddedActiveMQ();\nembedded.start();\n\nServerLocator serverLocator =  ActiveMQClient.createServerLocator(\"vm://0\");\nClientSessionFactory factory =  serverLocator.createSessionFactory();\nClientSession session = factory.createSession();\n\nsession.createQueue(new QueueConfiguration(\"example\"));\n\nClientProducer producer = session.createProducer(\"example\");\nClientMessage message = session.createMessage(true);\nmessage.getBody().writeString(\"Hello\");\nproducer.send(message);\n\nsession.start();\nClientConsumer consumer = session.createConsumer(\"example\");\nClientMessage msgReceived = consumer.receive();\nSystem.out.println(\"message = \" + msgReceived.getBody().readString());\nsession.close();\n\nThe EmbeddedActiveMQ class has a few additional setter methods that allow you\nto specify a different config file name as well as other properties.

Incoming and outgoing interceptors are be called for\nany packet entering or exiting the server respectively. This allows custom code\nto be executed, e.g. for auditing packets, filtering or other reasons.\nInterceptors can change the packets they intercept. This makes interceptors\npowerful, but also potentially dangerous.\nImplementing The Interceptors\nAll interceptors are protocol specific.\nAn interceptor for the core protocol must implement the interface\nInterceptor:\npackage org.apache.activemq.artemis.api.core.interceptor;\n\npublic interface Interceptor\n{\n   boolean intercept(Packet packet, RemotingConnection connection) throws ActiveMQException;\n}\n\nFor stomp protocol an interceptor must implement the interface StompFrameInterceptor:\npackage org.apache.activemq.artemis.core.protocol.stomp;\n\npublic interface StompFrameInterceptor extends BaseInterceptor\n{\n   boolean intercept(StompFrame stompFrame, RemotingConnection connection);\n}\n\nLikewise for MQTT protocol, an interceptor must implement the interface\nMQTTInterceptor:\npackage org.apache.activemq.artemis.core.protocol.mqtt;\n\npublic interface MQTTInterceptor extends BaseInterceptor\n{\n    boolean intercept(MqttMessage mqttMessage, RemotingConnection connection);\n}\n\nThe returned boolean value is important:\n\nif true is returned, the process continues normally\n\nif false is returned, the process is aborted, no other interceptors will be\ncalled and the packet will not be processed further by the server.\n\n\nConfiguring The Interceptors\nBoth incoming and outgoing interceptors are configured in broker.xml:\n\n   org.apache.activemq.artemis.jms.example.LoginInterceptor\n   org.apache.activemq.artemis.jms.example.AdditionalPropertyInterceptor\n\n\n\n   org.apache.activemq.artemis.jms.example.LogoutInterceptor\n   org.apache.activemq.artemis.jms.example.AdditionalPropertyInterceptor\n\n\nSee the documentation on adding runtime dependencies to\nunderstand how to make your interceptor available to the broker.\nInterceptors on the Client Side\nThe interceptors can also be run on the Apache ActiveMQ Artemit client side to\nintercept packets either sent by the client to the server or by the server to\nthe client.  This is done by adding the interceptor to the ServerLocator with\nthe addIncomingInterceptor(Interceptor) or\naddOutgoingInterceptor(Interceptor) methods.\nAs noted above, if an interceptor returns false then the sending of the\npacket is aborted which means that no other interceptors are be called and the\npacket is not be processed further by the client.  Typically this process\nhappens transparently to the client (i.e. it has no idea if a packet was\naborted or not). However, in the case of an outgoing packet that is sent in a\nblocking fashion a ActiveMQException will be thrown to the caller. The\nexception is thrown because blocking sends provide reliability and it is\nconsidered an error for them not to succeed. Blocking sends occurs when, for\nexample, an application invokes setBlockOnNonDurableSend(true) or\nsetBlockOnDurableSend(true) on its ServerLocator or if an application is\nusing a JMS connection factory retrieved from JNDI that has either\nblock-on-durable-send or block-on-non-durable-send set to true. Blocking\nis also used for packets dealing with transactions (e.g. commit, roll-back,\netc.). The ActiveMQException thrown will contain the name of the interceptor\nthat returned false.\nAs on the server, the client interceptor classes (and their dependencies) must\nbe added to the classpath to be properly instantiated and invoked.\nExamples\nSee the following examples which show how to use interceptors:\n\nInterceptor\nInterceptor AMQP\nInterceptor Client\nInterceptor MQTT\n\n"},"data-tools.html":{"url":"data-tools.html","title":"Data Tools","keywords":"","body":"Data Tools\nYou can use the Artemis CLI to execute data maintenance tools:\nThis is a list of sub-commands available\n\n\n\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nexp\nExport the message data using a special and independent XML format\n\n\nimp\nImports the journal to a running broker using the output from expt\n\n\ndata\nPrints a report about journal records and summary of existent records, as well a report on paging\n\n\nencode\nshows an internal format of the journal encoded to String\n\n\ndecode\nimports the internal journal format from encode\n\n\n\nYou can use the help at the tool for more information on how to execute each of the tools.

They can create a server, start, and do any CLI operation over servers.\nYou could for example use these maven plugins on your testsuite or deployment automation.\nGoals\nThere are three goals that you can use\n\ncreate\nThis will create a server accordingly to your arguments. You can do some extra tricks here such as installing extra libraries for external modules.\n\ncli\nThis will perform any CLI operation. This is basically a maven expression of the CLI classes\n\nrunClient\nThis is a simple wrapper around classes implementing a static main call. Notice that this won't spawn a new VM or new Thread.\n\n\nDeclaration\nOn your pom, use the plugins section:\n\n   \n      \n         org.apache.activemq\n         artemis-maven-plugin\n      \n   \n\n\ncreate goal\nI won't detail every operation of the create plugin here, but I will try to describe the main parameters:\n\n\n\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nconfiguration\nA place that will hold any file to replace on the configuration. For instance if you are providing your own broker.xml. Default is \"${basedir}/target/classes/activemq/server0\"\n\n\nhome\nThe location where you downloaded and installed artemis. Default is \"${activemq.basedir}\"\n\n\nalternateHome\nThis is used case you have two possible locations for your home (e.g. one under compile and one under production\n\n\ninstance\nWhere the server is going to be installed. Default is \"${basedir}/target/server0\"\n\n\nliblist[]\nA list of libraries to be installed under ./lib. ex: \"org.jgroups:jgroups:3.6.0.Final\"\n\n\n\nExample:\n\n   create\n   \n      create\n   \n   \n      ${noServer}\n   \n\n\ncli goal\nSome properties for the CLI\n\n\n\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nconfiguration\nA place that will hold any file to replace on the configuration. For instance if you are providing your own broker.xml. Default is \"${basedir}/target/classes/activemq/server0\"\n\n\nhome\nThe location where you downloaded and installed artemis. Default is \"${activemq.basedir}\"\n\n\nalternateHome\nThis is used case you have two possible locations for your home (e.g. one under compile and one under production\n\n\ninstance\nWhere the server is going to be installed. Default is \"${basedir}/target/server0\"\n\n\n\nSimilarly to the create plugin, the artemis exampels are using the cli plugin.

Apache\nActiveMQ Artemis also supports JDBC persistence, but there is a performance\ncost when persisting to a database vs local disk.\n\nPut the message journal on its own physical volume. If the disk is shared\nwith other processes e.g. transaction co-ordinator, database or other\njournals which are also reading and writing from it, then this may greatly\nreduce performance since the disk head may be skipping all over the place\nbetween the different files. One of the advantages of an append only journal is\nthat disk head movement is minimised - this advantage is destroyed if the disk\nis shared. If you're using paging or large messages make sure they're ideally\nput on separate volumes too.\n\nMinimum number of journal files. Set journal-min-files to a number of files\nthat would fit your average sustainable rate.  This number represents the\nlower threshold of the journal file pool.\n\nTo set the upper threshold of the journal file pool. (journal-min-files being\nthe lower threshold).  Set journal-pool-files to a number that represents\nsomething near your maximum expected load.  The journal will spill over the\npool should it need to, but will shrink back to the upper threshold, when\npossible.  This allows reuse of files, without taking up more disk space than\nrequired.  If you see new files being created on the journal data directory too\noften, i.e. lots of data is being persisted, you need to increase the\njournal-pool-size, this way the journal would reuse more files instead of\ncreating new data files, increasing performance\n\nJournal file size. The journal file size should be aligned to the capacity of\na cylinder on the disk. The default value 10MiB should be enough on most\nsystems.\n\nUse ASYNCIO journal. If using Linux, try to keep your journal type as\nASYNCIO. ASYNCIO will scale better than Java NIO.\n\nTune journal-buffer-timeout. The timeout can be increased to increase\nthroughput at the expense of latency.\n\nIf you're running ASYNCIO you might be able to get some better performance by\nincreasing journal-max-io. DO NOT change this parameter if you are running\nNIO.\n\nIf you are 100% sure you don't need power failure durability guarantees,\ndisable journal-data-sync and use NIO or MAPPED journal: you'll benefit\na huge performance boost on writes with process failure durability guarantees.  \n\n\nTuning JMS\nThere are a few areas where some tweaks can be done if you are using the JMS\nAPI\n\nDisable message id. Use the setDisableMessageID() method on the\nMessageProducer class to disable message ids if you don't need them. This\ndecreases the size of the message and also avoids the overhead of creating a\nunique ID.\n\nDisable message timestamp. Use the setDisableMessageTimeStamp() method on\nthe MessageProducer class to disable message timestamps if you don't need\nthem.\n\nAvoid ObjectMessage. ObjectMessage is convenient but it comes at a cost.\nThe body of a ObjectMessage uses Java serialization to serialize it to\nbytes. The Java serialized form of even small objects is very verbose so takes\nup a lot of space on the wire, also Java serialization is slow compared to\ncustom marshalling techniques. Only use ObjectMessage if you really can't use\none of the other message types, i.e. if you really don't know the type of the\npayload until run-time.\n\nAvoid AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE. AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE mode requires an acknowledgement\nto be sent from the server for each message received on the client, this\nmeans more traffic on the network. If you can, use DUPS_OK_ACKNOWLEDGE or use\nCLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE or a transacted session and batch up many acknowledgements\nwith one acknowledge/commit.\n\nAvoid durable messages. By default JMS messages are durable. If you don't\nreally need durable messages then set them to be non-durable.  Durable\nmessages incur a lot more overhead in persisting them to storage.\n\nBatch many sends or acknowledgements in a single transaction.  Apache\nActiveMQ Artemis will only require a network round trip on the commit, not on\nevery send or acknowledgement.\n\n\nOther Tunings\nThere are various other places in Apache ActiveMQ Artemis where we can perform\nsome tuning:\n\nUse Asynchronous Send Acknowledgements. If you need to send durable messages\nnon transactionally and you need a guarantee that they have reached the\nserver by the time the call to send() returns, don't set durable messages to be\nsent blocking, instead use asynchronous send acknowledgements to get your\nacknowledgements of send back in a separate stream, see Guarantees of sends\nand commits for more information on this.\n\nUse pre-acknowledge mode. With pre-acknowledge mode, messages are\nacknowledged before they are sent to the client. This reduces the amount of\nacknowledgement traffic on the wire. For more information on this, see Extra\nAcknowledge Modes.\n\nDisable security. You may get a small performance boost by disabling security\nby setting the security-enabled parameter to false in broker.xml.\n\nDisable persistence. If you don't need message persistence, turn it off\naltogether by setting persistence-enabled to false in broker.xml.\n\nSync transactions lazily. Setting journal-sync-transactional to false in\nbroker.xml can give you better transactional persistent performance at the\nexpense of some possibility of loss of transactions on failure. See\nGuarantees of sends and commits for more information.\n\nSync non transactional lazily. Setting journal-sync-non-transactional to\nfalse in broker.xml can give you better non-transactional persistent\nperformance at the expense of some possibility of loss of durable messages on\nfailure. See  Guarantees of sends and commits for more\ninformation.\n\nSend messages non blocking. Setting block-on-durable-send and\nblock-on-non-durable-send to false in the jms config (if you're using JMS\nand JNDI) or directly on the ServerLocator. This means you don't have to wait a\nwhole network round trip for every message sent. See  Guarantees of sends and\ncommits for more information.\n\nIf you have very fast consumers, you can increase consumer-window-size. This\neffectively disables consumer flow control.\n\nUse the core API not JMS. Using the JMS API you will have slightly lower\nperformance than using the core API, since all JMS operations need to be\ntranslated into core operations before the server can handle them. If using the\ncore API try to use methods that take SimpleString as much as possible.\nSimpleString, unlike java.lang.String does not require copying before it is\nwritten to the wire, so if you re-use SimpleString instances between calls\nthen you can avoid some unnecessary copying.\n\nIf using frameworks like Spring, configure destinations permanently broker\nside and enable cacheDestinations on the client side.  See the Setting The\nDestination Cache for more information on this.\n\n\nTuning Transport Settings\n\nTCP buffer sizes. If you have a fast network and fast machines you may get a\nperformance boost by increasing the TCP send and receive buffer sizes. See\nthe Configuring the Transport for more information\non this.\n\nNote:\nNote that some operating systems like later versions of Linux include TCP\nauto-tuning and setting TCP buffer sizes manually can prevent auto-tune\nfrom working and actually give you worse performance!\n\n\nIncrease limit on file handles on the server. If you expect a lot of\nconcurrent connections on your servers, or if clients are rapidly opening and\nclosing connections, you should make sure the user running the server has\npermission to create sufficient file handles.\nThis varies from operating system to operating system. On Linux systems you\ncan increase the number of allowable open file handles in the file\n/etc/security/limits.conf e.g. add the lines\nserveruser   soft  nofile  20000\nserveruser   hard  nofile  20000\nThis would allow up to 20000 file handles to be open by the user\nserveruser.\n\nUse batch-delay and set direct-deliver to false for the best throughput\nfor very small messages. Apache ActiveMQ Artemis comes with a preconfigured\nconnector/acceptor pair (netty-throughput) in broker.xml and JMS connection\nfactory (ThroughputConnectionFactory) in activemq-jms.xmlwhich can be used\nto give the very best throughput, especially for small messages. See the\nConfiguring the Transport for more information on\nthis.\n\n\nTuning the VM\nWe highly recommend you use the latest Java JVM for the best performance. We\ntest internally using the Sun JVM, so some of these tunings won't apply to JDKs\nfrom other providers (e.g. IBM or JRockit)\n\nGarbage collection. For smooth server operation we recommend using a parallel\ngarbage collection algorithm, e.g. using the JVM argument\n-XX:+UseParallelOldGC on Sun JDKs.\n\nMemory settings. Give as much memory as you can to the server.  Apache\nActiveMQ Artemis can run in low memory by using paging (described in\nPaging) but if it can run with all queues in RAM this will improve\nperformance.  The amount of memory you require will depend on the size and\nnumber of your queues and the size and number of your messages. Use the JVM\narguments -Xms and -Xmx to set server available RAM. We recommend setting\nthem to the same high value.\nWhen under periods of high load, it is likely that Artemis will be generating\nand destroying lots of objects. This can result in a build up of stale objects.\nTo reduce the chance of running out of memory and causing a full GC (which may\nintroduce pauses and unintentional behaviour), it is recommended that the max\nheap size (-Xmx) for the JVM is set at least to 5 x the global-max-size of\nthe broker.  As an example, in a situation where the broker is under high load\nand running with a global-max-size of 1GB, it is recommended the the max heap\nsize is set to 5GB.\n\n\nAvoiding Anti-Patterns\n\nRe-use connections / sessions / consumers / producers. Probably the most\ncommon messaging anti-pattern we see is users who create a new\nconnection/session/producer for every message they send or every message they\nconsume. This is a poor use of resources. These objects take time to create and\nmay involve several network round trips.  Always re-use them.\n\nNote:\nSome popular libraries such as the Spring JMS Template are known to use\nthese anti-patterns. If you're using Spring JMS Template and you're getting\npoor performance you know why. Don't blame Apache ActiveMQ Artemis! The\nSpring JMS Template can only safely be used in an app server which caches\nJMS sessions (e.g. using JCA), and only then for sending messages. It\ncannot be safely be used for synchronously consuming messages, even in an\napp server.\n\n\nAvoid fat messages. Verbose formats such as XML take up a lot of space on the\nwire and performance will suffer as result. Avoid XML in message bodies if\nyou can.\n\nDon't create temporary queues for each request. This common anti-pattern\ninvolves the temporary queue request-response pattern.  With the temporary\nqueue request-response pattern a message is sent to a target and a reply-to\nheader is set with the address of a local temporary queue. When the recipient\nreceives the message they process it then send back a response to the address\nspecified in the reply-to. A common mistake made with this pattern is to create\na new temporary queue on each message sent. This will drastically reduce\nperformance. Instead the temporary queue should be re-used for many requests.\n\nDon't use Message-Driven Beans for the sake of it. As soon as you start using\nMDBs you are greatly increasing the codepath for each message received\ncompared to a straightforward message consumer, since a lot of extra\napplication server code is executed. Ask yourself do you really need MDBs? Can\nyou accomplish the same task using just a normal message consumer?\n\n\nTroubleshooting\nUDP not working\nIn certain situations UDP used on discovery may not work. Typical situations are:\n\nThe nodes are behind a firewall. If your nodes are on different machines\nthen it is possible that the firewall is blocking the multicasts. you can\ntest this by disabling the firewall for each node or adding the appropriate\nrules.\nYou are using a home network or are behind a gateway. Typically home\nnetworks will redirect any UDP traffic to the Internet Service Provider\nwhich is then either dropped by the ISP or just lost. To fix this you will need\nto add a route to the firewall/gateway that will redirect any multicast traffic\nback on to the local network instead.\nAll the nodes are in one machine. If this is the case then it is a similar\nproblem to point 2 and the same solution should fix it. Alternatively you\ncould add a multicast route to the loopback interface. On linux the command\nwould be:\n# you should run this as root\nroute add -net 224.0.0.0 netmask 240.0.0.0 dev lo\n\nThis will redirect any traffic directed to the 224.0.0.0 to the loopback\ninterface. This will also work if you have no network at all. On Mac OS X, the\ncommand is slightly different:\nsudo route add 224.0.0.0 127.0.0.1 -netmask 240.0.0.0\n\n\n\n"},"configuration-index.html":{"url":"configuration-index.html","title":"Configuration Reference","keywords":"","body":"Configuration Reference\nThis section is a quick index for looking up configuration.

This document will share restart sequences for the\nbrokers under various circumstances when the client applications are \nconnected to it.\nRestarting 1 broker at a time\nWhen restarting the brokers one at a time at regular intervals, it is not\nimportant to follow any sequence. We just need to make sure that atleast\n1 broker in the master/slave pair is live to take up the connections from \nthe client applications.\nNote on restarting\n\nWhile restarting the brokers while the client applications are connected \nkindly make sure that atleast one broker is always live to serve the connected \nclients.\n\nCompletely shutting down the brokers and starting\nIf there is situation that we need to completely shutdown the brokers and \nstart them again, please follow the following procedure:\n\nShut down all the slave brokers.\nShut down all the master brokers.\nStart all the master brokers.\nStart all the slave brokers.\n\nThis sequence is particularly important in case of network replication for \nthe following reasons:\nIf the master broker is shutdown first, the slave broker will come live and accept \nall the client connections. Then when the slave broker is stopped, the clients will \nremain connected to the last live connection i.e. slave. Now, when we start the slave \nand master brokers, the clients will keep trying to connecting to the last connection \ni.e. with slave and will never be able to connect until we restart the client applications. \nTo avoid the hassle of restarting of client applications, we must follow the sequence \nas suggested above.\nSplit-brain situation\nThe following procedure helps the cluster to recover from the split-brain situation \nand getting the client connections auto-reconnected to the cluster.\nWith this sequence, client applications do not need to be restarted in order to make \nconnection with the brokers.\nDuring the split brain situation both the master and slave brokers are live and there is \nno replication that is happening from the master broker to the slave.\nIn such situation, there can be some client applications that are connected to the master \nbroker and other connected to the slave broker. Now after we restart the brokers and the \nthe cluster is properly formed.\nHere, the clients that were connected to the master broker during the split brain situation \nare auto-connected to the cluster and start processing the messages. But the clients that got \nconnected to the slave broker are still trying to make connection with the broker. This happens \nbecause the slave broker has restarted in 'back up' mode.\nThus, not all the clients get connected to the brokers and function properly.\nTo avoid such mishap, kindly follow the below sequence:\n\nStop the slave broker\nStart the slave broker. Observe the logs for the message \"Waiting for the master\"\nStop the master broker.\nStart the master broker.\nObserve the master broker logs for \"Server is live\"\nObserve the slave broker logs for \"backup announced\"\nStop the master broker again. Wait until the slave broker becomes live. Observe that all the \nclients are connected to the slave broker.\nStart the master broker. This time, all the connections will be switched to master broker again,\n\nNote on delta message loss on the slave broker\n\nDuring the split brain situation, messages are produced on the slave broker since it is live. \nWhile resolving the split brain situation, if there are some delta messages that are not produced \non the slave broker. Those messages cannot be auto-recovered. There will be manual intervention \nrequired to retrieve the messages, sometime it is almost impossible to recover the messages.\nThe above mentioned sequence helps in forming the cluster that was broken due to split brain \nand getting all the client applications to auto connected to the cluster without any need for \nclient applications to be restarted. \n\n"}}}
