<p>Apache ActiveMQ Artemis ships with two persistence options.
The file journal which is  highly optimized for the messaging use case and gives great performance, and also the JDBC Store, which uses JDBC to connect to a database of your choice.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="file-journal-default"><a class="anchor" href="#file-journal-default"></a><a class="link" href="#file-journal-default">1. File Journal (Default)</a></h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The file journal is an <em>append only</em> journal.
It consists of a set of files on disk.
Each file is pre-created to a fixed size and initially filled with padding.
As operations are performed on the server, e.g. add message, update message, delete message, records are appended to the journal.
When one journal file is full we move to the next one.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because records are only appended, i.e. added to the end of the journal we minimise disk head movement, i.e. we minimise random access operations which is typically the slowest operation on a disk.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Making the file size configurable means that an optimal size can be chosen, i.e. making each file fit on a disk cylinder.
Modern disk topologies are complex and we are not in control over which cylinder(s) the file is mapped onto so this is not an exact science.
But by minimising the number of disk cylinders the file is using, we can minimise the amount of disk head movement, since an entire disk cylinder is accessible simply by the disk rotating - the head does not have to move.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As delete records are added to the journal, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis has a sophisticated file garbage collection algorithm which can determine if a particular journal file is needed any more - i.e. has all its data been deleted in the same or other files.
If so, the file can be reclaimed and re-used.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Apache ActiveMQ Artemis also has a compaction algorithm which removes dead space from the journal and compresses up the data so it takes up less files on disk.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The journal also fully supports transactional operation if required, supporting both local and XA transactions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The majority of the journal is written in Java, however we abstract out the interaction with the actual file system to allow different pluggable implementations.
Apache ActiveMQ Artemis ships with two implementations:</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="journal-and-data-retention"><a class="anchor" href="#journal-and-data-retention"></a><a class="link" href="#journal-and-data-retention">1.1. Journal and Data Retention</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>ActiveMQ Artemis provides a way to store and replay historical data. Refer to <a href="data-retention.html">Data Retention</a> chapter for more information.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="java-nio"><a class="anchor" href="#java-nio"></a><a class="link" href="#java-nio">1.2. Java <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_I/O">NIO</a></a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first implementation uses standard Java NIO to interface with the file system.
This provides extremely good performance and runs on any platform where there&#8217;s a Java 6+ runtime.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="linux-asynchronous-io"><a class="anchor" href="#linux-asynchronous-io"></a><a class="link" href="#linux-asynchronous-io">1.3. Linux Asynchronous IO</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The second implementation uses a thin native code wrapper to talk to the Linux asynchronous IO library (AIO).
With AIO, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis will be called back when the data has made it to disk, allowing us to avoid explicit syncs altogether and simply send back confirmation of completion when AIO informs us that the data has been persisted.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Using AIO will typically provide even better performance than using Java NIO.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This journal option is only available when running Linux kernel 2.6 or later and after having installed libaio (if it&#8217;s not already installed).
For instructions on how to install libaio please see Installing AIO section.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Also, please note that AIO will only work with the following file systems: ext2, ext3, ext4, jfs, xfs and NFSV4.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For more information on libaio please see <a href="libaio.html#libaio-native-libraries">lib AIO</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>libaio is part of the kernel project.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="memory-mapped"><a class="anchor" href="#memory-mapped"></a><a class="link" href="#memory-mapped">1.4. Memory mapped</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The third implementation uses a file-backed <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/channels/FileChannel.MapMode.html#READ_WRITE">READ_WRITE</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory-mapped_file">memory mapping</a> against the OS page cache to interface with the file system.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This provides extremely good performance (especially under strictly process failure durability requirements),  almost zero copy (actually <em>is</em> the kernel page cache) and zero garbage (from the Java HEAP perspective) operations and runs  on any platform where there&#8217;s a Java 4+ runtime.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Under power failure durability requirements it will perform at least on par with the NIO journal with the only  exception of Linux OS with kernel less or equals 2.6, in which the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/MappedByteBuffer.html#force%28%29"><em>msync</em></a>) implementation necessary to ensure  durable writes was different (and slower) from the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/channels/FileChannel.html#force%28boolean%29"><em>fsync</em></a> used is case of NIO journal.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It benefits by the configuration of OS <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_%28computer_memory%29">huge pages</a>, in particular when is used a big number of journal files and sizing them as multiple of the OS page size in bytes.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="standard-files"><a class="anchor" href="#standard-files"></a><a class="link" href="#standard-files">1.5. Standard Files</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The standard Apache ActiveMQ Artemis core server uses two instances of the journal:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Bindings journal.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This journal is used to store bindings related data.
That includes the set of queues that are deployed on the server and their attributes.
It also stores data such as id sequence counters.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The bindings journal is always a NIO journal as it is typically low throughput compared to the message journal.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The files on this journal are prefixed as <code>activemq-bindings</code>.
Each file has a <code>bindings</code> extension.
File size is <code>1048576</code>, and it is located at the bindings folder.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Message journal.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This journal instance stores all message related data, including the message themselves and also duplicate-id caches.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By default Apache ActiveMQ Artemis will try and use an AIO journal.
If AIO is not available, e.g. the platform is not Linux with the correct kernel version or AIO has not been installed then it will automatically fall back to using Java NIO which is available on any Java platform.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The files on this journal are prefixed as <code>activemq-data</code>.
Each file has an <code>amq</code> extension.
File size is by the default <code>10485760</code> (configurable), and it is located at the journal folder.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For large messages, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis persists them outside the message journal.
This is discussed in <a href="large-messages.html#large-messages">Large Messages</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Apache ActiveMQ Artemis can also be configured to page messages to disk in low memory situations.
This is discussed in <a href="paging.html#paging">Paging</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If no persistence is required at all, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis can also be configured not to persist any data at all to storage as discussed in the Configuring the broker for Zero Persistence section.</p>

<p>This is the directory in which the message journal lives.
The default value is <code>data/journal</code>.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For the best performance, we recommend the journal is located on its own physical volume in order to minimise disk head movement.
If the journal is on a volume which is shared with other processes which might be writing other files (e.g. bindings journal, database, or transaction coordinator) then the disk head may well be moving rapidly between these files as it writes them, thus drastically reducing performance.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the message journal is stored on a SAN we recommend each journal instance that is stored on the SAN is given its own LUN (logical unit).</p>

If you choose <code>ASYNCIO</code> but are not running Linux or you do not have libaio installed then Apache ActiveMQ Artemis will detect this and automatically fall back to using <code>NIO</code>.
Choosing <code>MAPPED</code> chooses the Java Memory Mapped journal.</p>

<p>The minimum number of files the journal will maintain.
When Apache ActiveMQ Artemis starts and there is no initial message data, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis will pre-create <code>journal-min-files</code> number of files.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Creating journal files and filling them with padding is a fairly expensive operation and we want to minimise doing this at run-time as files get filled.
By pre-creating files, as one is filled the journal can immediately resume with the next one without pausing to create it.</p>
</div>

</div>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">journal-buffer-timeout</dt>
<dd>
<p>Instead of flushing on every write that requires a flush, we maintain an internal buffer, and flush the entire buffer either when it is full, or when a timeout expires, whichever is sooner.
This is used for both NIO and ASYNCIO and allows the system to scale better with many concurrent writes that require flushing.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This parameter controls the timeout at which the buffer will be flushed if it hasn&#8217;t filled already.
ASYNCIO can typically cope with a higher flush rate than NIO, so the system maintains different defaults for both NIO and ASYNCIO (default for NIO is 3333333 nanoseconds - 300 times per second, default for ASYNCIO is 500000 nanoseconds - ie.
2000 times per second).</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Any modern OS guarantees that on process failures (i.e. crash) all the uncommitted changes to the page cache will be flushed to the file system, maintaining coherence between  subsequent operations against the same pages and ensuring that no data will be lost.
The predictability of the timing of such flushes, in case of a disabled <em>journal-datasync</em>, depends on the OS configuration, but without compromising (or relaxing) the process  failure durability semantics as described above.
Rely on the OS page cache sacrifice the power failure protection, while increasing the  effectiveness of the journal operations, capable of exploiting  the read caching and write combining features provided by the OS&#8217;s kernel page cache subsystem.</p>

<div class="sidebarblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="title">Note on disabling disk write cache</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most disks contain hardware write caches.
A write cache can increase the apparent performance of the disk because writes just go into the cache and are then lazily written to the disk later.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This happens irrespective of whether you have executed a fsync() from the operating system or correctly synced data from inside a Java program!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By default many systems ship with disk write cache enabled.
This means that even after syncing from the operating system there is no guarantee the data has actually made it to disk, so if a failure occurs, critical data can be lost.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some more expensive disks have non volatile or battery backed write caches which won&#8217;t necessarily lose data on event of failure, but you need to test them!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If your disk does not have an expensive non volatile or battery backed cache and it&#8217;s not part of some kind of redundant array (e.g. RAID), and you value your data integrity you need to make sure disk write cache is disabled.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Be aware that disabling disk write cache can give you a nasty shock performance wise.
If you&#8217;ve been used to using disks with write cache enabled in their default setting, unaware that your data integrity could be compromised, then disabling it will give you an idea of how fast your disk can perform when acting really reliably.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On Linux you can inspect and/or change your disk&#8217;s write cache settings using the tools <code>hdparm</code> (for IDE disks) or <code>sdparm</code> or <code>sginfo</code> (for SDSI/SATA disks)</p>
</div>

<p>On Windows you can check / change the setting by right clicking on the disk and clicking properties.</p>

Some DBMS (e.g. Oracle, 30 chars) have restrictions on the size of table names, this should be taken into consideration when configuring table names for the Artemis database store, pay particular attention to the page store table name, which can be appended with a unique ID of up to 20 characters.

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In some situations, zero persistence is sometimes required for a messaging system.
Configuring Apache ActiveMQ Artemis to perform zero persistence is straightforward.
Simply set the parameter <code>persistence-enabled</code> in <code>broker.xml</code> to <code>false</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Please note that if you set this parameter to false, then <em>zero</em> persistence will occur.
That means no bindings data, message data, large message data, duplicate id caches or paging data will be persisted.</p>
