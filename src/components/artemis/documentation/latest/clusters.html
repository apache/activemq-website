<p>Apache ActiveMQ Artemis clusters allow groups of Apache ActiveMQ Artemis servers to be grouped together in order to share message processing load.
Each active node in the cluster is an active Apache ActiveMQ Artemis server which manages its own messages and handles its own connections.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The cluster is formed by each node declaring <em>cluster connections</em> to other nodes in the core configuration file <code>broker.xml</code>.
When a node forms a cluster connection to another node, internally it creates a <em>core bridge</em> (as described in <a href="core-bridges.html#core-bridges">Core Bridges</a>) connection between it and the other node, this is done transparently behind the scenes - you don&#8217;t have to declare an explicit bridge for each node.
These cluster connections allow messages to flow between the nodes of the cluster to balance load.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Nodes can be connected together to form a cluster in many different topologies, we will discuss a couple of the more common topologies later in this chapter.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We&#8217;ll also discuss client side load balancing, where we can balance client connections across the nodes of the cluster, and we&#8217;ll consider message redistribution where Apache ActiveMQ Artemis will redistribute messages between nodes to avoid starvation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another important part of clustering is <em>server discovery</em> where servers can broadcast their connection details so clients or other servers can connect to them with the minimum of configuration.</p>

<p>Once a cluster node has been configured it is common to simply copy that configuration to other nodes to produce a symmetric cluster.
However, care must be taken when copying the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis files.
Do not copy the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis <em>data</em> (i.e. the <code>bindings</code>, <code>journal</code>, <code>paging</code>, and <code>large-messages</code> directories) from one node to another.
When a node is started for the first time and initializes its journal files it also persists a special identifier to the <code>journal</code> directory.
This id <em>must</em> be unique among nodes in the cluster or the cluster will not form properly.</p>

<h2 id="performance-considerations"><a class="anchor" href="#performance-considerations"></a><a class="link" href="#performance-considerations">2. Performance Considerations</a></h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is important to note that while the goal of clustering is to increase overall message throughput via horizontal scaling it is not a "silver bullet." In certain situations clustering can, in fact, <em>reduce</em> message throughput so care must be taken when choosing a clustered configuration.
Here&#8217;s a few general guidelines:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p><strong>Establish a clear, concrete performance goal.</strong> Performance testing &amp; tuning are often difficult and tedious activities.
Small, relative gains will tempt you to keep going, and without a goal you will never know when to stop.
You need a goal to know "how good is good enough."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Start simple.</strong> Benchmark your use-case with a single broker first.
A single broker can handle <em>millions</em> of messages per second in certain  use-cases.
If you can&#8217;t meet your performance goal with a single broker only then move to a clustered configuration.
Only add complexity when there is a <em>clear benefit</em>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The main way a cluster can reduce overall message throughput is if there are are not enough producers &amp; consumers on each node leading to message build-up on some nodes and consumer starvation others.
The cluster has mechanisms to deal with this (i.e. message load-balancing &amp; redistribution, which will be covered later), but you really don&#8217;t want the broker to intervene and move messages between nodes unless absolutely necessary because <strong>that adds latency</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Therefore, when thinking in performance terms the main question one must answer when choosing a clustered configuration is: Do I have enough clients so that each node in the cluster has sufficient consumers to receive all the messages produced on that node?
If the answer to that question is "yes" then clustering may, in fact, improve overall message throughput for you.
If the answer to that question is "no" then you&#8217;re likely to get better performance from either a smaller cluster or just a single broker.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Also keep in mind that a <a href="connection-routers.html#connection-routers">connection router</a> may improve performance of your cluster by grouping related consumers and producers together on the same node.</p>
</div>
</div>

<h2 id="server-discovery"><a class="anchor" href="#server-discovery"></a><a class="link" href="#server-discovery">3. Server discovery</a></h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Server discovery is a mechanism by which servers can propagate their connection details to:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Messaging clients.
A messaging client wants to be able to connect to the servers of the cluster without having specific knowledge of which servers in the cluster are up at any one time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other servers.
Servers in a cluster want to be able to create cluster connections to each other without having prior knowledge of all the other servers in the cluster.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This information, let&#8217;s call it the Cluster Topology, is actually sent around normal Apache ActiveMQ Artemis connections to clients and to other servers over cluster connections.
This being the case we need a way of establishing the initial first connection.
This can be done using dynamic discovery techniques like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol">UDP</a> and <a href="http://www.jgroups.org/">JGroups</a>, or by providing a list of initial connectors.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="dynamic-discovery"><a class="anchor" href="#dynamic-discovery"></a><a class="link" href="#dynamic-discovery">3.1. Dynamic Discovery</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Server discovery uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol">UDP</a> multicast or <a href="http://www.jgroups.org/">JGroups</a> to broadcast server connection settings.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="broadcast-groups"><a class="anchor" href="#broadcast-groups"></a><a class="link" href="#broadcast-groups">3.1.1. Broadcast Groups</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A broadcast group is the means by which a server broadcasts connectors over the network.
A connector defines a way in which a client (or other server) can make connections to the server.
For more information on what a connector is, please see <a href="configuring-transports.html#configuring-the-transport">Configuring the Transport</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The broadcast group takes a connector and broadcasts it on the network.
Depending on which broadcasting technique you configure, it uses either UDP or JGroups to broadcast connector information.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Broadcast groups are defined in the server configuration file <code>broker.xml</code>.
There can be many broadcast groups per Apache ActiveMQ Artemis server.
All broadcast groups must be defined in a <code>broadcast-groups</code> element.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at an example broadcast group from <code>broker.xml</code> that defines a UDP broadcast group:</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some of the broadcast group parameters are optional and you&#8217;ll normally use the defaults, but we specify them all in the above example for clarity.
Let&#8217;s discuss each one in turn:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">name</dt>
<dd>
<p> attribute.
Each broadcast group in the server must have a unique name.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">local-bind-address</dt>
<dd>
<p>This is the local bind address that the datagram socket is bound to.
If you have multiple network interfaces on your server, you would specify which one you wish to use for broadcasts by setting this property.
If this property is not specified then the socket will be bound to the wildcard address, an IP address chosen by the kernel.
This is a UDP specific attribute.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">local-bind-port</dt>
<dd>
<p>If you want to specify a local port to which the datagram socket is bound you can specify it here.
Normally you would just use the default value of <code>-1</code> which signifies that an anonymous port should be used.
This parameter is always specified in conjunction with <code>local-bind-address</code>.
This is a UDP specific attribute.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">group-address</dt>
<dd>
<p>This is the multicast address to which the data will be broadcast.
It is a class D IP address in the range <code>224.0.0.0</code> to <code>239.255.255.255</code>, inclusive.
The address <code>224.0.0.0</code> is reserved and is not available for use.
This parameter is mandatory.
This is a UDP specific attribute.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">group-port</dt>
<dd>
<p>This is the UDP port number used for broadcasting.
This parameter is mandatory.
This is a UDP specific attribute.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">broadcast-period</dt>
<dd>
<p>This is the period in milliseconds between consecutive broadcasts.
This parameter is optional, the default value is <code>2000</code> milliseconds.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">connector-ref</dt>
<dd>
<p>This specifies the connector and optional backup connector that will be broadcasted (see <a href="configuring-transports.html#configuring-the-transport">Configuring the Transport</a> for more information on connectors).</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If cluster connections are defined between nodes of a cluster, then Apache ActiveMQ Artemis will load balance messages arriving at a particular node from a client.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s take a simple example of a cluster of four nodes A, B, C, and D arranged in a <em>symmetric cluster</em> (described in Symmetrical Clusters section).
We have a queue called <code>OrderQueue</code> deployed on each node of the cluster.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We have client Ca connected to node A, sending orders to the server.
We have also have order processor clients Pa, Pb, Pc, and Pd connected to each of the nodes A, B, C, D.
If no cluster connection was defined on node A, then as order messages arrive on node A they will all end up in the <code>OrderQueue</code> on node A, so will only get consumed by the order processor client attached to node A, Pa.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If we define a cluster connection on node A, then as ordered messages arrive on node A instead of all of them going into the local <code>OrderQueue</code> instance, they are distributed in a round-robin fashion between all the nodes of the cluster.
The messages are forwarded from the receiving node to other nodes of the cluster.
This is all done on the server side, the client maintains a single connection to node A.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, messages arriving on node A might be distributed in the following order between the nodes: B, D, C, A, B, D, C, A, B, D.
The exact order depends on the order the nodes started up, but the algorithm used is round robin.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Apache ActiveMQ Artemis cluster connections can be configured to always blindly load balance messages in a round robin fashion irrespective of whether there are any matching consumers on other nodes, but they can be a bit cleverer than that and also be configured to only distribute to other nodes if they have matching consumers.
We&#8217;ll look at both these cases in turn with some examples, but first we&#8217;ll discuss configuring cluster connections in general.</p>

<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">address</dt>
<dd>
<p>Each cluster connection only applies to addresses that match the specified <code>address</code> field.
An address is matched on the cluster connection when it begins with the string specified in this field.
The <code>address</code> field on a cluster connection also supports comma separated lists and an exclude syntax <code>!</code>.
To prevent an address from being matched on this cluster connection, prepend a cluster connection address string with <code>!</code>.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the case shown above the cluster connection will load balance messages sent to all addresses (since it&#8217;s empty).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The address can be any value and you can have many cluster connections with different values of <code>address</code>, simultaneously balancing messages for those addresses, potentially to different clusters of servers.
By having multiple cluster connections on different addresses a single Apache ActiveMQ Artemis Server can effectively take part in multiple clusters simultaneously.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Be careful not to have multiple cluster connections with overlapping values of <code>address</code>, e.g. "europe" and "europe.news" since this could result in the same messages being distributed between more than one cluster connection, possibly resulting in duplicate deliveries.</p>

It can be one of four values - <code>OFF</code>, <code>STRICT</code>, <code>OFF_WITH_REDISTRIBUTION</code> or <code>ON_DEMAND</code>  (default).
This parameter replaces the deprecated <code>forward-when-no-consumers</code> parameter.</p>

Note that Apache ActiveMQ Artemis will <em>not</em> forward messages to other nodes if there are no <em>queues</em> of the same name on the other nodes, even if this parameter is set to <code>STRICT</code>.
Using <code>STRICT</code> is like setting the legacy <code>forward-when-no-consumers</code> parameter to <code>true</code>.</p>

<h2 id="message-redistribution"><a class="anchor" href="#message-redistribution"></a><a class="link" href="#message-redistribution">7. Message Redistribution</a></h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another important part of clustering is message redistribution.
Earlier we learned how server side message load balancing round robins messages across the cluster.
If <code>message-load-balancing</code> is <code>OFF</code> or <code>ON_DEMAND</code> then messages won&#8217;t be forwarded to nodes which don&#8217;t have matching consumers.
This is great and ensures that messages aren&#8217;t moved to a queue which has no consumers to consume them.
However, there is a situation it doesn&#8217;t solve: What happens if the consumers on a queue close after the messages have been sent to the node?
If there are no consumers on the queue the message won&#8217;t get consumed and we have a <em>starvation</em> situation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is where message redistribution comes in.
With message redistribution Apache ActiveMQ Artemis can be configured to automatically <em>redistribute</em> messages from queues which have no consumers or consumers with filters that don&#8217;t match messages.
The messages are re-routed to other nodes in the cluster which do have matching consumers.
To enable this functionality <code>message-load-balancing</code> must be <code>ON_DEMAND</code> or <code>OFF_WITH_REDISTRIBUTION</code></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Message redistribution can be configured to kick in immediately after the need to redistribute is detected, or to wait a configurable delay before redistributing.
By default, message redistribution is disabled.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Message redistribution can be configured on a per address basis, by specifying the redistribution delay in the address settings.
For more information on configuring address settings, please see <a href="address-settings.html#address-settings">Configuring Addresses and Queues via Address Settings</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here&#8217;s an address settings snippet from <code>broker.xml</code> showing how message redistribution is enabled for a set of queues:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="rouge highlight nowrap"><code data-lang="xml"><span class="nt">&lt;address-settings&gt;</span>
   <span class="nt">&lt;address-setting</span> <span class="na">match=</span><span class="s">"#"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
      <span class="nt">&lt;redistribution-delay&gt;</span>0<span class="nt">&lt;/redistribution-delay&gt;</span>
   <span class="nt">&lt;/address-setting&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/address-settings&gt;</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The above <code>address-settings</code> block would set a <code>redistribution-delay</code> of <code>0</code> for any queue which is bound to any address.
So the above would enable instant (no delay) redistribution for all addresses.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The attribute <code>match</code> can be an exact match or it can be a string that conforms to the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis wildcard syntax (described in <a href="wildcard-syntax.html#wildcard-syntax">Wildcard Syntax</a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The element <code>redistribution-delay</code> defines the delay in milliseconds between detecting the need for redistribution and actually attempting redistribution.
A delay of zero means the messages will be immediately redistributed.
A value of <code>-1</code> signifies that messages will never be redistributed.
The default value is <code>-1</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It often makes sense to introduce a delay before redistributing as it&#8217;s a common case that a consumer closes but another one quickly is created on the same queue, in such a case you probably don&#8217;t want to redistribute immediately since the new consumer will arrive shortly.</p>

<p>Apache ActiveMQ Artemis clusters can be connected together in many different topologies, let&#8217;s consider the two most common ones here</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="symmetric-cluster"><a class="anchor" href="#symmetric-cluster"></a><a class="link" href="#symmetric-cluster">8.1. Symmetric cluster</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A symmetric cluster is probably the most common cluster topology.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With a symmetric cluster every node in the cluster is connected to every other node in the cluster.
In other words every node in the cluster is no more than one hop away from every other node.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To form a symmetric cluster every node in the cluster defines a cluster connection with the attribute <code>max-hops</code> set to <code>1</code>.
Typically the cluster connection will use server discovery in order to know what other servers in the cluster it should connect to, although it is possible to explicitly define each target server too in the cluster connection if, for example, UDP is not available on your network.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With a symmetric cluster each node knows about all the queues that exist on all the other nodes and what consumers they have.
With this knowledge it can determine how to load balance and redistribute messages around the nodes.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="chain-cluster"><a class="anchor" href="#chain-cluster"></a><a class="link" href="#chain-cluster">8.2. Chain cluster</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With a chain cluster, each node in the cluster is not connected to every node in the cluster directly, instead the nodes form a chain with a node on each end of the chain and all other nodes just connecting to the previous and next nodes in the chain.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An example of this would be a three node chain consisting of nodes A, B and C.
Node A is hosted in one network and has many producer clients connected to it sending order messages.
Due to corporate policy, the order consumer clients need to be hosted in a different network, and that network is only accessible via a third network.
In this setup node B acts as a mediator with no producers or consumers on it.
Any messages arriving on node A will be forwarded to node B, which will in turn forward them to node C where they can get consumed.
Node A does not need to directly connect to C, but all the nodes can still act as a part of the cluster.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To set up a cluster in this way, node A would define a cluster connection that connects to node B, and node B would define a cluster connection that connects to node C.
In this case we only want cluster connections in one direction since we&#8217;re only moving messages from node A-&gt;B-&gt;C and never from C-&gt;B-&gt;A.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For this topology we would set <code>max-hops</code> to <code>2</code>.
With a value of <code>2</code> the knowledge of what queues and consumers that exist on node C would be propagated from node C to node B to node A.
Node A would then know to distribute messages to node B when they arrive, even though node B has no consumers itself, it would know that a further hop away is node C which does have consumers.</p>

<h3 id="scaling-down"><a class="anchor" href="#scaling-down"></a><a class="link" href="#scaling-down">8.3. Scaling Down</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Apache ActiveMQ Artemis supports scaling down a cluster with no message loss (even for non-durable messages).
This is especially useful in certain environments (e.g. the cloud) where the size of a cluster may change relatively frequently.
When scaling up a cluster (i.e. adding nodes) there is no risk of message loss, but when scaling down a cluster (i.e. removing nodes) the messages on those nodes would be lost unless the broker sent them to another node in the cluster.
Apache ActiveMQ Artemis can be configured to do just that.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To enable this behavior configure <code>scale-down</code> in the <code>live-only</code> <code>ha-policy</code>, e.g.:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="rouge highlight nowrap"><code data-lang="xml"><span class="nt">&lt;ha-policy&gt;</span>
   <span class="nt">&lt;live-only&gt;</span>
      <span class="nt">&lt;scale-down&gt;</span>
         <span class="nt">&lt;enabled&gt;</span>true<span class="nt">&lt;/enabled&gt;</span>
         <span class="nt">&lt;discovery-group-ref</span> <span class="na">discovery-group-name=</span><span class="s">"my-discovery-group"</span><span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
      <span class="nt">&lt;/scale-down&gt;</span>
   <span class="nt">&lt;/live-only&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/ha-policy&gt;</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If <code>scale-down</code>/<code>enabled</code> is <code>true</code> then when the server is shutdown gracefully (i.e. stopped without crashing) it will find another node in the cluster and send <em>all</em> of its messages (both durable and non-durable) to that node.
The messages are processed in order and go to the <em>back</em> of the respective queues on the other node (just as if the messages were sent from an external client for the first time).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>target</em> of the scale down operation can be configured a few differnt ways.
The above example uses <code>discovery-group-ref</code> to reference a <code>discovery-group</code> which will be used to find the target broker.
This should be the same <code>discovery-group</code> referenced by your <code>cluster-connection</code>.
You can also specify a static list of <code>connector</code> elements, e.g.:</p>

<span class="nt">&lt;/ha-policy&gt;</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s also possible to specify <code>group-name</code>.
If this is specified then messages will only be sent to another node in the cluster that uses the same <code>group-name</code> as the server being shutdown, e.g.:</p>
