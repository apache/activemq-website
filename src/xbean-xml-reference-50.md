copyMessage

_boolean_

Sets whether a copy of the message will be sent to each destination. Defaults to true so that the forward destination is set as the destination of the message

forwardOnly

### The _\<connectionFactory>_ Element

A [Spring](http://www.springframework.org/) enhanced connection factory which will automatically use the Spring bean name as the clientIDPrefix property so that connections created have client IDs related to your Spring.xml file for easier comprehension from [JMX](jmx).

#### Properties

Property Name

Type

Description

alwaysSessionAsync

_boolean_

If this flag is set then a separate thread is not used for dispatching messages for each Session in the Connection. However, a separate thread is always used if there is more than one session, or the session isn't in auto acknowledge or duplicates ok mode

alwaysSyncSend

_boolean_

Set true if always require messages to be sync sent

beanName

_java.lang.String_

blobTransferPolicy

_org.apache.activemq.blob.BlobTransferPolicy_

Sets the policy used to describe how out-of-band BLOBs (Binary Large OBjects) are transferred from producers to brokers to consumers

brokerURL

_java.lang.String_

Sets the [connection URL](configuring-transports) used to connect to the ActiveMQ broker.

clientID

_java.lang.String_

Sets the JMS clientID to use for the created connection. Note that this can only be used by one connection at once so generally its a better idea to set the clientID on a Connection

clientIDPrefix

_java.lang.String_

Sets the prefix used by autogenerated JMS Client ID values which are used if the JMS client does not explicitly specify on.

clientIdGenerator

_org.apache.activemq.util.IdGenerator_

closeTimeout

_int_

Sets the timeout before a close is considered complete. Normally a close() on a connection waits for confirmation from the broker; this allows that operation to timeout to save the client hanging if there is no broker

copyMessageOnSend

_boolean_

Should a JMS message be copied to a new JMS Message object as part of the send() method in JMS. This is enabled by default to be compliant with the JMS specification. You can disable it if you do not mutate JMS messages after they are sent for a performance boost

disableTimeStampsByDefault

_boolean_

Sets whether or not timestamps on messages should be disabled or not. If you disable them it adds a small performance boost.

dispatchAsync

_boolean_

Enables or disables the default setting of whether or not consumers have their messages [dispatched synchronously or asynchronously by the broker](consumer-dispatch-async). For non-durable topics for example we typically dispatch synchronously by default to minimize context switches which boost performance. However sometimes its better to go slower to ensure that a single blocked consumer socket does not block delivery to other consumers.

exclusiveConsumer

_boolean_

Enables or disables whether or not queue consumers should be exclusive or not for example to preserve ordering when not using [Message Groups](message-groups)

nestedMapAndListEnabled

_boolean_

Enables/disables whether or not Message properties and MapMessage entries support [Nested Structures](structured-message-properties-and-mapmessages) of Map and List objects

objectMessageSerializationDefered

_boolean_

When an object is set on an ObjectMessage, the JMS spec requires the object to be serialized by that set method. Enabling this flag causes the object to not get serialized. The object may subsequently get serialized if the message needs to be sent over a socket or stored to disk.

optimizeAcknowledge

_boolean_

optimizedMessageDispatch

_boolean_

If this flag is set then an larger prefetch limit is used - only applicable for durable topic subscribers.

password

_java.lang.String_

Sets the JMS password used for connections created from this factory

prefetchPolicy

_org.apache.activemq.ActiveMQPrefetchPolicy_

Sets the [prefetch policy](what-is-the-prefetch-limit-for) for consumers created by this connection.

producerWindowSize

_int_

properties

_java.util.Properties_

Get the properties from this instance for storing in JNDI

redeliveryPolicy

_org.apache.activemq.RedeliveryPolicy_

Sets the global redelivery policy to be used when a message is delivered but the session is rolled back

statsEnabled

_boolean_

transformer

_org.apache.activemq.MessageTransformer_

Sets the transformer used to transform messages before they are sent on to the JMS bus or when they are received from the bus but before they are delivered to the JMS client

transportListener

_org.apache.activemq.transport.TransportListener_

Allows a listener to be configured on the ConnectionFactory so that when this factory is used with frameworks which don't expose the Connection such as Spring JmsTemplate, you can still register a transport listener.

useAsyncSend

_boolean_

Forces the use of [Async Sends](async-sends) which adds a massive performance boost; but means that the send() method will return immediately whether the message has been sent or not which could lead to message loss.

useBeanNameAsClientIdPrefix

_boolean_

useCompression

_boolean_

Enables the use of compression of the message bodies

useRetroactiveConsumer

_boolean_

Sets whether or not retroactive consumers are enabled. Retroactive consumers allow non-durable topic subscribers to receive old messages that were published before the non-durable subscriber started.

userName

_java.lang.String_

Sets the JMS userName used by connections created by this factory

warnAboutUnstartedConnectionTimeout

_long_

Enables the timeout from a connection creation to when a warning is generated if the connection is not properly started via {@link Connection#start()} and a message is received by a consumer. It is a very common gotcha to forget to [start the connection](i-am-not-receiving-any-messages-what-is-wrong) so this option makes the default case to create a warning if the user forgets. To disable the warning just set the value to < 0 (say -1).

#### Properties

Property Name

Type

Description

alwaysSessionAsync

_boolean_

If this flag is set then a separate thread is not used for dispatching messages for each Session in the Connection. However, a separate thread is always used if there is more than one session, or the session isn't in auto acknowledge or duplicates ok mode

alwaysSyncSend

_boolean_

Set true if always require messages to be sync sent

beanName

_java.lang.String_

blobTransferPolicy

_org.apache.activemq.blob.BlobTransferPolicy_

Sets the policy used to describe how out-of-band BLOBs (Binary Large OBjects) are transferred from producers to brokers to consumers

brokerURL

_java.lang.String_

Sets the [connection URL](configuring-transports) used to connect to the ActiveMQ broker.

clientID

_java.lang.String_

Sets the JMS clientID to use for the created connection. Note that this can only be used by one connection at once so generally its a better idea to set the clientID on a Connection

clientIDPrefix

_java.lang.String_

Sets the prefix used by autogenerated JMS Client ID values which are used if the JMS client does not explicitly specify on.

clientIdGenerator

_org.apache.activemq.util.IdGenerator_

closeTimeout

_int_

Sets the timeout before a close is considered complete. Normally a close() on a connection waits for confirmation from the broker; this allows that operation to timeout to save the client hanging if there is no broker

copyMessageOnSend

_boolean_

Should a JMS message be copied to a new JMS Message object as part of the send() method in JMS. This is enabled by default to be compliant with the JMS specification. You can disable it if you do not mutate JMS messages after they are sent for a performance boost

disableTimeStampsByDefault

_boolean_

Sets whether or not timestamps on messages should be disabled or not. If you disable them it adds a small performance boost.

dispatchAsync

_boolean_

Enables or disables the default setting of whether or not consumers have their messages [dispatched synchronously or asynchronously by the broker](consumer-dispatch-async). For non-durable topics for example we typically dispatch synchronously by default to minimize context switches which boost performance. However sometimes its better to go slower to ensure that a single blocked consumer socket does not block delivery to other consumers.

exclusiveConsumer

_boolean_

Enables or disables whether or not queue consumers should be exclusive or not for example to preserve ordering when not using [Message Groups](message-groups)

nestedMapAndListEnabled

_boolean_

Enables/disables whether or not Message properties and MapMessage entries support [Nested Structures](structured-message-properties-and-mapmessages) of Map and List objects

objectMessageSerializationDefered

_boolean_

When an object is set on an ObjectMessage, the JMS spec requires the object to be serialized by that set method. Enabling this flag causes the object to not get serialized. The object may subsequently get serialized if the message needs to be sent over a socket or stored to disk.

optimizeAcknowledge

_boolean_

optimizedMessageDispatch

_boolean_

If this flag is set then an larger prefetch limit is used - only applicable for durable topic subscribers.

password

_java.lang.String_

Sets the JMS password used for connections created from this factory

prefetchPolicy

_org.apache.activemq.ActiveMQPrefetchPolicy_

Sets the [prefetch policy](what-is-the-prefetch-limit-for) for consumers created by this connection.

producerWindowSize

_int_

properties

_java.util.Properties_

Get the properties from this instance for storing in JNDI

redeliveryPolicy

_org.apache.activemq.RedeliveryPolicy_

Sets the global redelivery policy to be used when a message is delivered but the session is rolled back

statsEnabled

_boolean_

transformer

_org.apache.activemq.MessageTransformer_

Sets the transformer used to transform messages before they are sent on to the JMS bus or when they are received from the bus but before they are delivered to the JMS client

transportListener

_org.apache.activemq.transport.TransportListener_

Allows a listener to be configured on the ConnectionFactory so that when this factory is used with frameworks which don't expose the Connection such as Spring JmsTemplate, you can still register a transport listener.

useAsyncSend

_boolean_

Forces the use of [Async Sends](async-sends) which adds a massive performance boost; but means that the send() method will return immediately whether the message has been sent or not which could lead to message loss.

useBeanNameAsClientIdPrefix

_boolean_

useCompression

_boolean_

Enables the use of compression of the message bodies

useRetroactiveConsumer

_boolean_

Sets whether or not retroactive consumers are enabled. Retroactive consumers allow non-durable topic subscribers to receive old messages that were published before the non-durable subscriber started.

userName

_java.lang.String_

Sets the JMS userName used by connections created by this factory

warnAboutUnstartedConnectionTimeout

_long_

Enables the timeout from a connection creation to when a warning is generated if the connection is not properly started via {@link Connection#start()} and a message is received by a consumer. It is a very common gotcha to forget to [start the connection](i-am-not-receiving-any-messages-what-is-wrong) so this option makes the default case to create a warning if the user forgets. To disable the warning just set the value to < 0 (say -1).

watchTopicAdvisories
