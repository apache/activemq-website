#### Prior updates

#### Reporting new security problems with Apache ActiveMQ components

We strongly encourage people to report security problems privately, using the
security mailing list of the ASF Security Team, before disclosing them in a
public forum.

Please see the [ASF Security Team](https://www.apache.org/security/) pages
for contact information and further detail on the process.

The ASF Security Team cannot accept regular bug reports or other queries,
mail sent to tthem which does not relate to security problems in Apache
software will be ignored.

General questions such as those about using ActiveMQ components, or whether an
exiting published vulnerability applies to your application, etc, should be
addressed to our regular channels, e.g the users mailing list. Please see the
[Contact page](contact) for details of how to subscribe.
