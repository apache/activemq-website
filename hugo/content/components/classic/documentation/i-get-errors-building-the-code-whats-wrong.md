We currently use a multi-project maven build system, which can be a little fragile. If you are ever having problems building we suggest you try the following in the root _activemq_ directory
```
mvn clean
rm -rf ~/.m2/repository
mvn
```
You may also want to [disable the unit tests](how-do-i-build-but-disable-the-unit-tests)
