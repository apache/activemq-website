If you get an exception like this
```
java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError - org/springframework/core/io/Resource
```

### Cause

You were probably trying to use the [XML Configuration](xml-configuration) mechanism, which uses Spring, but without having the Spring jar on your classpath.

### Solution

Add the Spring jar to your classpath.
