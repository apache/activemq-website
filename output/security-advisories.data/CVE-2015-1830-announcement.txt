CVE-2015-1830 - Path traversal leading to unauthenticated RCE in ActiveMQ

Severity: Important

Vendor:
The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
Apache ActiveMQ 5.0.0 - 5.11.1

Description:

There is a directory traversal flaw in the fileserver upload/download functionality used for blob messages. 
The attacker can put a jsp file in the admin console and execute shell command from there. It’s only vulnerable in the Windows OS.

Mitigation:

Upgrade to Apache ActiveMQ 5.12.0 or 5.11.2. The workaround in case fileserver is not used and upgrade is not prefereable is to disable that functionality. It can be done by removing (commenting out) the following lines from conf\jetty.xml file

<bean class="org.eclipse.jetty.webapp.WebAppContext">
    <property name="contextPath" value="/fileserver" />
    <property name="resourceBase" value="${activemq.home}/webapps/fileserver" />
    <property name="logUrlOnStart" value="true" />
    <property name="parentLoaderPriority" value="true" />
</bean>
