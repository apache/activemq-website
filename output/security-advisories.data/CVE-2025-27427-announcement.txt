Affected versions:

- Apache ActiveMQ Artemis 2.0.0 through 2.39.0

Description:

A vulnerability exists in Apache ActiveMQ Artemis whereby a user with the createDurableQueue or createNonDurableQueue permission on an address can augment the routing-type supported by that address even if said user doesn't have the createAddress permission for that particular address. When combined with the send permission and automatic queue creation a user could successfully send a message with a routing-type not supported by the address when that message should actually be rejected on the basis that the user doesn't have permission to change the routing-type of the address.

This issue affects Apache ActiveMQ Artemis from 2.0.0 through 2.39.0.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.40.0 which fixes the issue.

This issue is being tracked as ARTEMIS-5346
