<p>This feature provides a way of balancing the load of a single queue across remote brokers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A federated queue links to other queues (called upstream queues).
It will retrieve messages from upstream queues in order to satisfy demand for messages from local consumers.
The upstream queues do not need to be reconfigured and they do not have to be on the same broker or in the same cluster.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All of the configuration needed to establish the upstream links and the federated queue is in the downstream broker.</p>

<p>This is not an exhaustive list of what you can do with and the benefits of federated queues, but simply some ideas.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Higher capacity</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By having a "logical" queue distributed over many brokers.
Each broker would declare a federated queue with all the other federated queues upstream.
(The links would form a complete bi-directional graph on n queues.)</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By having this a logical distributed queue is capable of having a much higher capacity than a single queue on a single broker.
When will perform best when there is some degree of locality.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>e.g. as many messages as possible are consumed from the same broker as they were published to, where federation only needs to move messages around in order to perform load balancing.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Supporting multi region or venue</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In a multi region setup you may have producers in one region or venue and the consumer in another.
typically you want producers and consumer to keep their connections local to the region, in such as case you can deploy brokers in each region where producers and consumer are, and use federation to move messages over the WAN between regions.</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Communication between the secure enterprise lan and the DMZ.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Where a number of producer apps maybe in the DMZ and a number of consumer apps in the secure enterprise lan, it may not suitable to allow the producers to connect through to the broker in the secure enterprise lan.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this scenario you could deploy a broker in the DMZ where the producers publish to, and then have the broker in the enterprise lan connect out to the DMZ broker and federate the queues so that messages can traverse.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is similar to supporting multi region or venue.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Migrating between two clusters.
Consumers and publishers can be moved in any order and the messages won&#8217;t be duplicated (which is the case if you do exchange federation).
Instead, messages are transferred to the new cluster when your consumers are there.
Here for such a migration with blue/green or canary moving a number of consumers on the same queue, you may want to set the <code>priority-adjustment</code> to 0, or even a positive value, so message would actively flow to the federated queue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dual Federation - potential for messages to flip-flop between clusters.
If the backlog on your queues exceeds the available local credit across consumers, any lower priority federation consumer becomes a candidate for dispatch and messages will be federated.
Eventually all messages may migrate and the scenario can repeat on the other cluster.
Applying a rate limit to the connector url can help mitigate but this could have an adverse effect on migration when there are no local consumers.
To better support this use case, it is possible to configure the consumerWindowSize to zero on the referenced connector URI: <code>tcp://&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;?consumerWindowSize=0</code>.
This will cause the federation consumer to pull messages in batches only when the local queue has excess capacity.
This means that federation won&#8217;t ever drain more messages than it can handle, such that messages would flip-flop.
The batch size is derived from the relevant address settings defaultConsumerWindowSize.</p>
