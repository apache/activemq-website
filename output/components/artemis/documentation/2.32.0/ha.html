<div class="paragraph">
<p>Apache ActiveMQ Artemis allows servers to be linked together as <em>primary/backup</em> groups where each primary server can have 1 or more backup servers.
A backup server is owned by only one primary server.
Backup servers are not operational until failover occurs.
However, one chosen backup, which will be passive, announces its status and waits to take over the primary server&#8217;s work.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before failover, only the primary server is active, serving clients while the backup servers remain passive, awaiting to become active when the primary fails.
When a primary server crashes or is brought down in the correct mode the backup server currently in passive mode will activate.
If a primary server restarts after a failover then it will be passive and have priority and be the next server to become active when the current active backup server goes down.
If the active backup server is configured to allow automatic failback then it will detect the primary server coming back up and automatically stop.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>replication</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>When using replication, the primary and the backup servers do not share the same data directories, all data synchronization is done over the network.
Therefore all (persistent) data received by the primary server will be duplicated to the backup.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Notice that upon start-up the backup server will first need to synchronize all existing data from the primary server before becoming capable of replacing the primary server should it fail.
So unlike when using shared storage, a replicating backup will not be a fully operational backup right after start-up, but only after it finishes synchronizing the data with its primary server.
The time it will take for this to happen will depend on the amount of data to be synchronized and the connection speed.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In general, synchronization occurs in parallel with current network traffic so this won&#8217;t cause any blocking on current clients.
However, there is a critical moment at the end of this process where the replicating server must complete the synchronization and ensure the replica acknowledges this completion.
This exchange between the replicating server and replica will block any journal related operations.
The maximum length of time that this exchange will block is controlled by the <code>initial-replication-sync-timeout</code> configuration element.</p>

<p>Replication will create a copy of the data at the backup.
One issue to be aware of is: in case of a successful fail-over, the backup&#8217;s data will be newer than the primary&#8217;s data.
If you configure your backup to allow failback to the primary then when the primary is restarted it will be passive and the active backup will synchronize its data with the passive primary before stopping to allow the passive primary to become active again.
If both servers are shutdown then the administrator will have to determine which one has the latest data.</p>

<p>The replicating primary and backup pair must be part of a cluster.
The Cluster Connection also defines how backup servers will find the remote primary servers to pair with.
Refer to <a href="clusters.html#clusters">Clusters</a> for details on how this is done, and how to configure a cluster connection.
Notice that:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>

<p>Both primary and backup servers must be part of the same cluster.

<p>You can specify a group of primary servers that a backup server can connect to.
This is done by configuring <code>group-name</code> in either the <code>primary</code> or the <code>backup</code> element of the <code>broker.xml</code>.
A backup will only connect to a primary that shares the same node group name.</p>

<p>This is an important distinction from a shared-store backup, if a backup starts and does not find a primary server, the server will just activate and start to serve client requests.
In the replication case, the backup just keeps waiting for a primary server to pair with.
Note that in replication the backup server does not know whether any data it might have is up to date, so it really cannot decide to activate automatically.
To activate a replicating backup server using the data it has, the administrator must change its configuration to make it a primary server by changing <code>backup</code> to <code>primary</code>.</p>

<p>Much like in the shared-store case, when the primary server stops or crashes, its backup will become active and take over its duties.
Specifically, the backup will become active when it loses connection to its primary server.
This can be problematic because it can also happen as the result of temporary network problem.</p>

<p>The issue can be solved in two different ways, depending on which replication roles are configured:</p>

<p><strong>non-pluggable replication</strong>: backup will try to determine whether it still can connect to the other servers in the cluster.
If it can connect to more than half the servers, it will become active. If more than half the servers also disappeared with the primary, the backup will wait and try reconnecting with the primary.
This avoids a split brain situation.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>pluggable replication</strong>: backup relies on a pluggable quorum provider (configurable via <code>manager</code> xml element) to detect if there&#8217;s any active primary.</p>

<p>After failover and the backup has become active, this is set on the new active server.
It represents the amount of time the replicating server will wait at the completion of the initial replication process for the replica to acknowledge it has received all the necessary data.
The default is 30,000 milliseconds.</p>

the higher, the slower.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GC on broker machine should allow keeping GC pauses within 1/3 of <code>session_ms</code> in order to let the ZooKeeper heartbeat protocol work reliably.
If that is not possible, it is better to increase <code>session_ms</code>, accepting a slower failover.</p>

<li>
<p>ZooKeeper must have enough resources to keep GC (and OS) pauses much smaller than server tick time: please consider carefully if  broker and ZooKeeper node should share the same physical machine, depending on the expected load of the broker</p>

It is possible to have two peer servers compete for activation;
the winner activating as live, the looser taking up a backup role.
On restart, 'any' peer server with the most up to date journal can activate.
The instances need to know in advance, what identity they will coordinate on.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>When using a shared store both primary and backup servers share the <em>same</em> entire data directory using a shared file system.
This means the paging directory, journal directory, large messages and binding journal.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When failover occurs and a backup server takes over, it will load the persistent storage from the shared file system and clients can connect to it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This style of high availability differs from data replication in that it requires a shared file system which is accessible by both the primary and backup nodes.
Typically this will be some kind of high performance Storage Area Network (SAN).
We do not recommend you use Network Attached Storage (NAS), e.g. NFS mounts to store any shared journal (NFS is slow).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The advantage of shared-store high availability is that no replication occurs between the primary and backup nodes. This means it does not suffer any performance penalties due to the overhead of replication during normal operation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The disadvantage of shared store replication is that it requires a shared file system, and when the backup server activates it needs to load the journal from the shared store which can take some time depending on the amount of data in the store.</p>

<p>With non-pluggable replication you need to set an extra property <code>check-for-active-server</code> to <code>true</code> in the <code>primary</code> configuration.
If set to <code>true</code> then during start-up the primary server will first search the cluster for another active server using its nodeID.
If it finds one it will contact this server and try to "fail-back".
Since this is a remote replication scenario the primary will have to synchronize its data with the backup server running with its ID. Once they are in sync it will request the other server (which it assumes it is a backup that has assumed its duties) to shutdown in order for it to take over.
This is necessary because otherwise the primary server has no means to know whether there was a fail-over or not, and if there was, if the server that took its duties is still running or not.

<p>One key difference between pluggable replication and non-pluggable replication is that with non-pluggable replication if the primary cannot reach any active server with its nodeID then it activates unilaterally.
With pluggable replication the responsibilities of coordination are delegated to the quorum provider. There are no unilateral decisions.
The primary will only activate when it knows that it has the most up to date version of the journal identified by its nodeID.</p>

<p>It is also possible when running standalone to colocate backup servers in the same JVM as another primary server.
Primary Servers can be configured to request another primary server in the cluster to start a backup server in the same JVM either using shared store or replication.

A primary server can also be configured to allow requests from backups and also how many backups a primary server can start.
This way you can evenly distribute backups around the cluster.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>An alternative to using primary/backup groups is to configure <em>scaledown</em>.
When configured for scale down a server can copy all its messages and transaction state to another active server.
The advantage of this is that you don&#8217;t need full backups to provide some form of HA, however there are disadvantages with this approach the first being that it only deals with a server being stopped and not a server crash.
The caveat here is if you configure a backup to scale down.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another disadvantage is that it is possible to lose message ordering.
This happens in the following scenario, say you have 2 active servers and messages are distributed evenly between the servers from a single producer, if one of the servers scales down then the messages sent back to the other server will be in the queue after the ones already there, so server 1 could have messages 1,3,5,7,9 and server 2 would have 2,4,6,8,10, if server 2 scales down the order in server 1 would be 1,3,5,7,9,2,4,6,8,10.</p>

<p>It is also possible to mix scale down with HA via backup servers.
If a backup is configured to scale down then after failover has occurred, instead of starting fully the backup server will immediately scale down to another active server.

It means that as you bring up primary servers they will automatically be backed up, and as they are shutdown their messages are made available on another active server.

<p>Apache ActiveMQ Artemis clients can be configured to receive knowledge of all primary and backup servers, so that in event of connection failure the client will detect this and reconnect to the backup server.
The backup server will then automatically recreate any sessions and consumers that existed on each connection before failover, thus saving the user from having to hand-code manual reconnection logic.

<div class="title">A Note on Server Replication</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Apache ActiveMQ Artemis does not replicate full server state between active and passive servers.
When the new session is automatically recreated on the backup it won&#8217;t have any knowledge of messages already sent or acknowledged in that session.
Any in-flight sends or acknowledgements at the time of failover might also be lost.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By replicating full server state, theoretically we could provide a 100% transparent seamless failover, which would avoid any lost messages or acknowledgements, however this comes at a great cost: replicating the full server state (including the queues, session, etc.).
This would require replication of the entire server state machine; every operation on the primary server would have to replicated on the replica server(s) in the exact same global order to ensure a consistent replica state.
This is extremely hard to do in a performant and scalable way, especially when one considers that multiple threads are changing the active&#8217;s server state concurrently.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is possible to provide full state machine replication using techniques such as <em>virtual synchrony</em>, but this does not scale well and effectively serializes all operations to a single thread, dramatically reducing concurrency.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Other techniques for multi-threaded active replication exist such as replicating lock states or replicating thread scheduling but this is very hard to achieve at a Java level.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Consequently it has been decided that it worth not worth massively reducing performance and concurrency for the sake of 100% transparent failover.
Even without 100% transparent failover, it is simple to guarantee <em>once and only once</em> delivery, even in the case of failure, by using a combination of duplicate detection and retrying of transactions.
However this is not 100% transparent to the client code.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the client code is in a blocking call to the server, waiting for a response to continue its execution, when failover occurs, the new session will not have any knowledge of the call that was in progress.
This call might otherwise hang for ever, waiting for a response that will never come.</p>

<p>To prevent this, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis will unblock any blocking calls that were in progress at the time of failover by making them throw a <code>javax.jms.JMSException</code> (if using JMS), or a <code>ActiveMQException</code> with error code <code>ActiveMQException.UNBLOCKED</code>.
It is up to the client code to catch this exception and retry any operations if desired.</p>

<p>If the method being unblocked is a call to commit(), or prepare(), then the transaction will be automatically rolled back and Apache ActiveMQ Artemis will throw a <code>javax.jms.TransactionRolledBackException</code> (if using JMS), or a <code>ActiveMQException</code> with error code <code>ActiveMQException.TRANSACTION_ROLLED_BACK</code> if using the core API.</p>

This informs the Transaction Manager that it should retry the commit at some later point in time, a side effect of this is that any non persistent messages will be lost.

<p>Apache ActiveMQ Artemis clients retrieve the backup connector from the topology updates that the cluster brokers send.
If the connection options of the clients don&#8217;t match the options of the cluster brokers the clients can define a client connector that will be used in place of the connector in the topology.
To define a client connector it must have a name that matches the name of the connector defined in the <code>cluster-connection</code> of the broker, i.e. supposing to have a primary broker with the cluster connector name <code>node-0</code> and a backup broker with the <code>cluster-connector</code> name <code>node-1</code> the client connection url must define 2 connectors with the names <code>node-0</code> and <code>node-1</code>:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>JMS provides a standard mechanism for getting notified asynchronously of connection failure: <code>java.jms.ExceptionListener</code>.
Please consult the JMS javadoc or any good JMS tutorial for more information on how to use this.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Apache ActiveMQ Artemis core API also provides a similar feature in the form of the class <code>org.apache.activemq.artemis.core.client.SessionFailureListener</code></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Any ExceptionListener or SessionFailureListener instance will always be called by ActiveMQ Artemis on event of connection failure, <strong>irrespective</strong> of whether the connection was successfully failed over, reconnected or reattached, however you can find out if reconnect or reattach has happened by either the <code>failedOver</code> flag passed in on the <code>connectionFailed</code> on <code>SessionfailureListener</code> or by inspecting the error code on the <code>javax.jms.JMSException</code> which will be one of the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>JMSException error codes:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">FAILOVER</dt>
<dd>
<p>Failover has occurred and we have successfully reattached or reconnected.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">DISCONNECT</dt>
<dd>
<p>No failover has occurred and we are disconnected.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>

<h3 id="application-level-failover"><a class="anchor" href="#application-level-failover"></a><a class="link" href="#application-level-failover">3.4. Application-Level Failover</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In some cases you may not want automatic client failover, and prefer to handle any connection failure yourself, and code your own manually reconnection logic in your own failure handler.
We define this as <em>application-level</em> failover, since the failover is handled at the user application level.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To implement application-level failover, if you&#8217;re using JMS then you need to set an <code>ExceptionListener</code> class on the JMS connection.
The <code>ExceptionListener</code> will be called by Apache ActiveMQ Artemis in the event that connection failure is detected.
In your <code>ExceptionListener</code>, you would close your old JMS connections, potentially look up new connection factory instances from JNDI and creating new connections.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For a working example of application-level failover, please see <a href="examples.html#application-layer-failover">the Application-Layer Failover Example</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you are using the core API, then the procedure is very similar: you would set a <code>FailureListener</code> on the core <code>ClientSession</code> instances.</p>
