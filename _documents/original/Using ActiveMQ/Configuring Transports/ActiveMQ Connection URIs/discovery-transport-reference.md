### The Discovery Transport

The Discovery transport works just like the [Failover](Using ActiveMQ/Configuring Transports/ActiveMQ Connection URIs/failover-transport-reference.md) transport, except that it uses a discovery agent to locate the list of uri to connect to. The Discovery transport is also used by the [Fanout](Using ActiveMQ/Configuring Transports/ActiveMQ Connection URIs/fanout-transport-reference.md) transport for discovering brokers to send a fanout message to.

#### Configuration Syntax

**discovery:(discoveryAgentURI)?transportOptions**  
or  
**discovery:discoveryAgentURI**

Note that to be able to use [Discovery](Features/discovery.md) to find brokers, the brokers need to have the multicast discovery agent enabled on the broker.

To configure discovery in a Broker you should use the [Xml Configuration](xml-Community/FAQ/configuration.md). Here is an [example](http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/activemq/trunk/activemq-core/src/test/resources/org/apache/activemq/usecases/receiver-discovery.xml?view=co) of using discovery. Its basically something like the following (see the **discoveryUri**)

<broker name="foo">
  <transportConnectors>
    <transportConnector uri="tcp://localhost:0" discoveryUri="multicast://default"/>
  </transportConnectors>

  ...
</broker>

##### Transport Options

Option Name

Default Value

Description

reconnectDelay

10

How long to wait for discovery

initialReconnectDelay

10

How long to wait before the first reconnect attempt to a discovered url

maxReconnectDelay

30000

The maximum amount of time we ever wait between reconnect attempts

useExponentialBackOff

true

Should an exponential backoff be used btween reconnect attempts

backOffMultiplier

2

The exponent used in the exponential backoff attempts

maxReconnectAttempts

0

If not 0, then this is the maximum number of reconnect attempts before an error is sent back to the client

group

default

an identifier for the group to partition multi cast traffic among collaborating peers; the group forms part of the shared identity of a discovery datagram (since 5.2)

##### Example URI

discovery:(multicast://default)?initialReconnectDelay=100

Applying parameters to discovered transports

From 5.4, transport parameters in the URI will also be applied to discovered transports if they are prefixed with `discovered.`; For example, adding the `discovered.connectionTimeout` parameter to the URI will apply the parameter to every discovered [TCP](Using ActiveMQ/Configuring Transports/ActiveMQ Connection URIsUsing ActiveMQ/Configuring Transports/ActiveMQ Connection URIs/Using ActiveMQ/Configuring Transports/ActiveMQ Connection URIs/tcp-transport-reference.md) transport, even though this parameter is not a Discovery transport option.
