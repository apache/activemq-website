Apache ActiveMQ ™ -- Discovery 

[Features](../features.md) > [Discovery](../Features/discovery.md)


Discovery Agents
----------------

ActiveMQ uses an abstraction called a [Discovery Agent](http://actievmq.apache.org/maven/activemq-core/apidocs/org/apache/activemq/transport/discovery/DiscoveryAgent.html) to detect remote services such as remote brokers. We can use discovery for JMS clients to auto-detect a Message Broker to connect to, or to provide [Networks of Brokers](../Features/Clustering/networks-of-brokers.md)

There are currently two kinds of discovery agent.

### Multicast

The Discovery transport uses our own Multicast based discovery agent to locate the list of URIs to connect to.

For more information see the [Discovery Transport Reference](../Using ActiveMQ/Configuring Transports/ActiveMQ Connection URIs/discovery-transport-reference.md).

### Zeroconf

[ZeroConf](../Using ActiveMQ/Configuring Transports/ZeroConf Transport Reference/zeroconf.md) is a standard discovery specification that uses UDP / multicast to discovery devices. Its used by Apple's Rendezvous services.  
We use the [jmDNS](http://jmdns.sf.net/) project to implement the Zeroconf specification to detect services. This means other Zeroconf  
based tools can be used in conjunction with this discovery agent.

To configure discovery in a Broker you should use the [Xml Configuration](xml-Community/FAQ/configuration.md). Here is an [example](http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/activemq/trunk/activemq-unit-tests/src/test/resources/org/apache/activemq/usecases/receiver-zeroconf.xml?view=co) of using discovery to create [Networks of Brokers](../Features/Clustering/networks-of-brokers.md).

If you have one or more brokers running with Zeroconf discovery enabled you can connect to a broker using the brokerURL

zeroconf:\_activemq\_development.

This will use Zeroconf to find an available broker and one will be randomly chosen & things will auto-failover on disconnect if there are several brokers running.

### LDAP Discovery

ActiveMQ supports the use of LDAP for discovery of brokers.

Please see [LDAP Broker Discovery Mechanism](../Using ActiveMQ 5/ldap-broker-discovery-mechanism.md) for more details.

Trying out discovery
--------------------

If you run the following commands in separate shells you'll have 2 brokers auto-discovering themselves and 2 clients using fixed-URLs

maven -o server -Dconfig=src/test/org/activemq/usecases/receiver-zeroconf.xml
maven -o server -Dconfig=src/test/org/activemq/usecases/sender-zeroconf.xml
maven -o consumer -Durl=tcp://localhost:62002
maven -o producer -Durl=tcp://localhost:62001

If you want the clients to use discovery to find brokers, run either of the two 'server' statements above (or both) then run the producer/consumer as follows

maven -o consumer -Durl=zeroconf:_activemq.broker.development.
maven -o producer  -Durl=zeroconf:_activemq.broker.development.

The transport URL is of the format

    zeroconf:<serviceName>

where _<serviceName>_ is the Zeroconf service name; which seems to start with an underscore (_) and must end with a dot (.). So we can use this service name to distinguish development, UAT & production brokers - or group them into domains etc.

Discovery and Security
----------------------

When using auto discovery of brokers an attacker may be able to present itself as a legitimate broker and by this way catch and / or manipulate all messages that run over it.

Are there security settings in auto discovery to avoid this?
