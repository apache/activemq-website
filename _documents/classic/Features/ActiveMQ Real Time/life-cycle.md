Life cycle of Channels
----------------------

Blaze Channels are in one of five states:

### Constructed - the Channel isn't initialized or has been shutDown

### initialized -

you can explicitly initialize a Channel by invoking its init() method. At this point its Configuration is set

 BlazeChannelFactory factory = new BlazeChannelFactory();
 BlazeChannel channel = factory.createChannel();
 channel.init();

### started -

this will implicitly initialize the channel and start the Channel's underlying communication with its peers:

 BlazeChannelFactory factory = new BlazeChannelFactory();
 BlazeChannel channel = factory.createChannel();
 channel.start();

### stopped -

this will stop communication - however you are able to re-start the channel at a latter point

 BlazeChannelFactory factory = new BlazeChannelFactory();
 BlazeChannel channel = factory.createChannel();
 channel.stop();
 // do something else
 ...
 //re-start
 channel.start();

### shut down

*   this will implicitly call stop() - and de-construct the channel. It is possible to re-initialize the channel again - and it is recommend that to apply configuration changes to the channel - it be shut down and re-started - e.g.

 BlazeChannelFactory factory = new BlazeChannelFactory();
 BlazeChannel channel = factory.createChannel();
 channel.shutDown();
 // change the congiguration
 channel.getConfiguration().setBroadcastURI("tcp://localhost:60661");
 //re-start
 channel.start();
