Apache ActiveMQ ™ -- Unix Service 

[Features](../../features.md) > [Unix](../../Features/unix.md) > [Unix Service](../../Features/Unix/unix-service.md)


This page contained a very basic procedure to create a unix service for activemq.

Due to the fact that ActiveMQ contains a very functional init script - this is not needed anymore.

**Review the documentation of the init script: [Unix Shell Script](../../Features/Unix/unix-shell-script.md)**
