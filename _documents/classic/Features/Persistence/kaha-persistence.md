Kaha Persistence
----------------

Kaha Peristence is a storage solution written especially for message persistence and is part of the ActiveMQ project. It's tuned to provide optimal performance for typical message usage patterns, which involves writing/reading and discarding messages that are persisted very quickly.

Data stored in Kaha is appended to data logs - the log files are discarded once there is no longer interest in the data contained in the log.

### Configuring Kaha Persistence

In the broker XML specify the persistence adaptor to be Kaha e.g.

ActiveMQ 5.0 and above:

 <broker brokerName="broker" persistent="true" useShutdownHook="false">
    <transportConnectors>
      <transportConnector uri="tcp://localhost:61616"/>
    </transportConnectors>
    <persistenceAdapter>
      <kahaPersistenceAdapter directory="activemq-data" maxDataFileLength="33554432"/>
    </persistenceAdapter>
  </broker>

ActiveMQ 4.1 and earlier:

 <broker brokerName="broker" persistent="true" useShutdownHook="false">
    <transportConnectors>
      <transportConnector uri="tcp://localhost:61616"/>
    </transportConnectors>
    <persistenceAdapter>
      <kahaPersistenceAdapter dir="activemq-data" maxDataFileLength="33554432"/>
    </persistenceAdapter>
  </broker>
