Connection Configuration URI
----------------------------

An Apache ActiveMQ connection can be configured by explicitly setting properties on the [ActiveMQConnection](http://activemq.apache.org/maven/apidocs/org/apache/activemq/ActiveMQConnection.html) or [ActiveMQConnectionFactory](http://activemq.apache.org/maven/apidocs/org/apache/activemq/ActiveMQConnectionFactory.html) objects themselves via the bean properties or using the following URI syntax.

### Example

You set the property called **`jms.$PROPERTY`** on a regular connection URI. For example you can set the **`brokerURL`** on your [ActiveMQConnectionFactory](http://activemq.apache.org/maven/apidocs/org/apache/activemq/ActiveMQConnectionFactory.html) to the following value to enable [Async Sends](../../../Features/Message Dispatching Features/async-sends.md)

tcp://localhost:61616?jms.useAsyncSend=true

### Connection Options

Use the Correct Prefix!

The following options should be prefixed with **`jms.`** when used on a **`brokerURL`** or a broker's transport connector.

Option Name

Default Value

Description

`alwaysSessionAsync`

`true`

When **`true`** a separate thread is used for dispatching messages for each Session in the Connection.

A separate thread is always used when there's more than one session, or the session isn't in **`Session.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE`** or **`Session.DUPS_OK_ACKNOWLEDGE`** mode.

`alwaysSyncSend`

`false`

When **`true`** a **`MessageProducer`** will always use Sync sends when sending a Message even if it is not required for the Delivery Mode.

`auditDepth`

`2048`

The size of the message window that will be audited for duplicates and out of order messages.

`auditMaximumProducerNumber`

`64`

Maximum number of producers that will be audited.

`checkForDuplicates`

`true`

When **`true`** the consumer will check for duplicate messages and properly handle the message to make sure that it is not processed twice inadvertently.

`clientID`

`null`

Sets the JMS clientID to use for the connection.

`closeTimeout`

`15000`

Sets the timeout, in milliseconds, before a close is considered complete. Normally a **`close()`** on a connection waits for confirmation from the broker.

This allows the close operation to timeout preventing the client from hanging when no broker is available.

`consumerExpiryCheckEnabled`

`true`

Controls whether message expiration checking is done in each **`MessageConsumer`** prior to dispatching a message. Disabling this check can lead to consumption of expired messages. (since 5.11).

`copyMessageOnSend`

`true`

Should a JMS message be copied to a new JMS Message object as part of the **`send()`** method in JMS. This is enabled by default to be compliant with the JMS specification.

For a performance boost set to **`false`** if you do not mutate JMS messages after they are sent.

`disableTimeStampsByDefault`

`false`

Sets whether or not timestamps on messages should be disabled or not.

For a small performance boost set to **`false`**.

`dispatchAsync`

`false`

Should the broker [dispatch messages asynchronously](../../../Features/Consumer Features/consumer-dispatch-async.md) to the consumer?

`nestedMapAndListEnabled`

`true`

Controls whether [Structured Message Properties and MapMessages](../../../Features/Message Features/structured-message-properties-and-mapmessages.md) are supported so that Message properties and **`MapMessage`** entries can contain nested Map and List objects. Available from version 4.1.

`objectMessageSerializationDefered`

`false`

When an object is set on an **`ObjectMessage`** the JMS spec requires the object be serialized by that set method.

When **`true`** the object will not be serialized. The object may subsequently be serialized if the message needs to be sent over a socket or stored to disk.

`optimizeAcknowledge`

`false`

Enables an optimized acknowledgement mode where messages are acknowledged in batches rather than individually. Alternatively, you could use **`Session.DUPS_OK_ACKNOWLEDGE`** acknowledgement mode for the consumers which can often be faster.

**WARNING**: enabling this issue could cause some issues with auto-acknowledgement on reconnection.

`optimizeAcknowledgeTimeOut`

`300`

If > 0, specifies the max time, in milliseconds, between batch acknowledgements when **`optimizeAcknowledge`** is enabled. (since 5.6).

`optimizedAckScheduledAckInterval`

`0`

If > 0, specifies a time interval upon which all the outstanding ACKs are delivered when optimized acknowledge is used so that a long running consumer that doesn't receive any more messages will eventually ACK the last few un-ACK'ed messages (since 5.7).

`optimizedMessageDispatch`

`true`

If **`true`** a larger prefetch limit is used - only applicable for durable topic subscribers.

`useAsyncSend`

`false`

Forces the use of [Async Sends](../../../Features/Message Dispatching Features/async-sends.md) which adds a massive performance boost; but means that the **`send()`** method will return immediately whether the message has been sent or not which could lead to message loss.

`useCompression`

`false`

Enables the use of compression on the message's body.

`useRetroactiveConsumer`

`false`

Sets whether or not retroactive consumers are enabled. Retroactive consumers allow non-durable topic subscribers to receive old messages that were published before the non-durable subscriber started.

`warnAboutUnstartedConnectionTimeout`

`500`

The timeout, in milliseconds, from the time of connection creation to when a warning is generated if the connection is not properly started via [Connection.start()](http://java.sun.com/j2ee/1.4/docs/api/javax/jms/Connection.html#start()) and a message is received by a consumer. It is a very common gotcha to forget to [start the connection and then wonder why no messages are delivered](../../../FAQ/Errors/i-am-not-receiving-any-messages-what-is-wrong.md) so this option makes the default case to create a warning if the user forgets.

To disable the warning just set the value to **`< 0`**.

### Nested Options

You can also configure nested objects on the connection object using the given prefixes. See the javadoc for a breakdown of each individual property.
