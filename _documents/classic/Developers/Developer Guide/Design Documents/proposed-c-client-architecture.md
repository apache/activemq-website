4/16/06 - Attaching wire_formats.pdf - a first cut at defining all of the commands for both openwire an stomp.  Working toward an architecture that will support both. 

/////////////////////////////////////////////// 

Given that there are several separate efforts going on now toward the common goal of creating an ActiveMQ c++ client, I've put together a [doc](http://docs.codehaus.org/download/attachments/48149/ActiveMQClientArchitecture.pdf)that attempts to merge our complete set of goals and propose an architecture (in rough form) that meets those goals.  I've stored the document here because it was too large for the distribution list.

Please review and provide feedback at your earliest convenience.

 Regards,

Nathan Mittler
