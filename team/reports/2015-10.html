      <h5 class="text-green">Health Report</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>As the number and scope of the recent releases shows, there is a lot of development occurring throughout all of the ActiveMQ products </li>
        <li>Many bugs are being raised, but they are being looked at fairly promptly </li>
        <li>There were a couple of bugs raised that resulted in good “cross team” discussions as to whether the bug was, indeed, a bug or a desired change in behavior</li>
        <li>While some of these discussions did hold up the creations of a patch release (5.12.1), it was important for the team to reach a consensus on the outcome and plans are starting to finish the release</li>
