project_top_narative: The CMS API is a JMS-like API for C++ for interfacing with Message Brokers such as Apache ActiveMQ. CMS helps to make your C++ client code much neater and easier to follow. To get a better feel for CMS try the API Reference. ActiveMQ-CPP is a client only library, a message broker such as Apache ActiveMQ is still needed for your clients to communicate.

                      <p>The CMS API, providers, etc. are no longer under active development, and no maintenance resources have stepped forward. With the rise of AMQP as an industry standard protocol with good cross-platform support the need for CMS has diminished. For a C++ client implementation which can be used with ActiveMQ brokers please refer to <a href="https://qpid.apache.org/proton">Qpid Proton</a>.</p>

                      <p>CMS (stands for C++ Messaging Service) is a JMS-like API for C++ for interfacing with Message Brokers such as Apache ActiveMQ. CMS helps to make your C++ client code much neater and easier to follow. To get a better feel for CMS try the API Reference. ActiveMQ-CPP is a client only library, a message broker such as Apache ActiveMQ is still needed for your clients to communicate.</p>
                      <p>Our implementation of CMS is called ActiveMQ-CPP, which has an architecture that allows for pluggable transports and wire formats. Currently we support the OpenWire and Stomp protocols, both over TCP and SSL, we also now support a Failover Transport for more reliable client operation. In addition to CMS, ActiveMQ-CPP also provides a robust set of classes that support platform independent constructs such as threading, I/O, sockets, etc. You may find many of these utilities very useful, such as a Java like Thread class or the "synchronized" macro that let's you use a Java-like synchronization on any object that implements the activemq::concurrent::Synchronizable interface. ActiveMQ-CPP is released under the <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html">Apache 2.0 License</a>.</p>
