Configuring NMS.Stomp
---------------------

All configuration is achieved via URI-encoded parameters, either on the connection or destinations. Through the URIs, you can configure virtually every facet of your NMS.Stomp client. The tables below show the comprehensive set of parameters.

### **Connection URI Parameters**

#####  Example Configuration

Using the Generic NMSConnectionFactory class would look as follows:

var cf = new NMSConnectionFactory(
    "stomp:tcp://localhost:61613");

You can also use the Stomp ConecctionFactory implementation directory:

var cf = new Apache.NMS.Stomp.ConnectionFactory(
    "tcp://localhost:61613");

### Protocol Options

Option Name  

Description

tcp

Uses TCP/IP Sockets to connect to the Broker.

ssl

Uses TCP/IP Sockets to connect to the Broker with an added SSL layer (Not available on .NETCF).

failover

Uses the Failover Transport to connect and reconnect to one or more Brokers

You can add the failover option using the Generic NMSConnectionFactory class like this:

var cf = new NMSConnectionFactory(
    "stomp:failover:tcp://localhost:61613");

You can also use the Stomp ConecctionFactory implementation directory:

var cf = new Apache.NMS.Stomp.ConnectionFactory(
    "failover:tcp://localhost:61613");

#### **Transport Options**

##### **TCP Transport Options**

Option Name

Default

Description

transport.useLogging

false

Log data that is sent across the Transport.

transport.receiveBufferSize

8192

Amount of Data to buffer from the Socket

transport.sendBufferSize

8192

Amount of Data to buffer before writing to the Socket

transport.receiveTimeout

0

Time to wait for more data, zero means wait infinitely

transport.sendTimeout

0

Timeout on sends, 0 means wait forever for completion

transport.requestTimeout

0

Time to wait before a Request Command is considered to have failed

##### Failover Transport Options

Prior to NMS.Stomp v1.4.0 the failover transport options did not use the transport.* prefix.

Option Name

Default

Description

transport.timeout

-1

Time that a send operation blocks before failing.

transport.initialReconnectDelay

10

Time in Milliseconds that the transport waits before attempting to reconnect the first time.

transport.maxReconnectDelay

30000

The max time in Milliseconds that the transport will wait before attempting to reconnect.

transport.backOffMultiplier

2

The amount by which the reconnect delay will be multiplied by if useExponentialBackOff is enabled.

transport.useExponentialBackOff

true

Should the delay between connection attempt grow on each try up to the max reconnect delay.

transport.randomize

true

Should the Uri to connect to be chosen at random from the list of available Uris.

transport.maxReconnectAttempts

0

Maximum number of time the transport will attempt to reconnect before failing (0 means infinite retries)

transport.startupMaxReconnectAttempts

0

Maximum number of time the transport will attempt to reconnect before failing when there has never been a connection made. (0 means infinite retries) **(included in NMS.Stomp v1.5.0+)**

transport.reconnectDelay

10

The delay in milliseconds that the transport waits before attempting a reconnection.

#### **Connection Options**

Option Name

Default

Description

connection.AsyncSend

false

Are message sent Asynchronously.

connection.AsyncClose

true

Should the close command be sent Asynchronously

connection.AlwaysSyncSend

false

Causes all messages a Producer sends to be sent Asynchronously.

connection.CopyMessageOnSend

true

Copies the Message objects a Producer sends so that the client can reuse Message objects without affecting an in-flight message.

connection.useCompression

false

Should message bodies be compressed before being sent.

connection.sendAcksAsync

false

Should message acks be sent asynchronously

connection.messagePrioritySupported

true

Should messages be delivered to the client based on the value of the Message Priority header.

connection.dispatchAsync

false

Should the broker [dispatch messages asynchronously](http://activemq.apache.orgFeatures/Consumer FeaturesFeatures/Consumer Features/Features/Consumer Features/consumer-dispatch-async.md) to the connection's consumers.

##### **Stomp Wire Protocol Options**

Be Careful

These values are currently not supported but are planned for a later release.

Option Name

Default

Description

wireFormat.maxInactivityDuration

30000

The maximum inactivity duration (before which the socket is considered dead) in milliseconds. On some platforms it can take a long time for a socket to appear to die, so we allow the broker to kill connections if they are inactive for a period of time. Use by some transports to enable a keep alive heart beat feature. Set to a value <= 0 to disable inactivity monitoring.

wireFormat.maxInactivityDurationInitialDelay

10000

The initial delay in starting the maximum inactivity checks (and, yes, the word 'Initial' is supposed to be misspelled like that)

### **Destination URI Parameters**

##### Example Configuration

d = session.CreateTopic("com.foo?consumer.prefetchSize=2000&consumer.noLocal=true");

#### **General Options**

Option Name

Default

Description

consumer.prefetchSize

1000

The number of message the consumer will [prefetch](http://activemq.apache.orgCommunity/FAQ/Using Apache ActiveMQCommunity/FAQ/Using Apache ActiveMQ/Community/FAQ/Using Apache ActiveMQ/what-is-the-prefetch-limit-for.md).

consumer.noLocal

false

Same as the noLocal flag on a Topic consumer. Exposed here so that it can be used with a queue.

consumer.dispatchAsync

false

Should the broker [dispatch messages asynchronously](http://activemq.apache.orgFeatures/Consumer FeaturesFeatures/Consumer Features/Features/Consumer Features/consumer-dispatch-async.md) to the consumer.

consumer.retroactive

false

Is this a [Retroactive Consumer](http://activemq.apache.orgFeatures/Consumer FeaturesFeatures/Consumer Features/Features/Consumer Features/retroactive-consumer.md).

consumer.selector

null

JMS Selector used with the consumer.

consumer.exclusive

false

Is this an [Exclusive Consumer](http://activemq.apache.orgFeatures/Consumer Features/exclusive-consumer.md).
