Configuring NMS.ActiveMQ
------------------------

All configuration is achieved via URI-encoded parameters, either on the connection or destinations. Through the URIs, you can configure virtually every facet of your NMS.ActiveMQ client. The tables below show the comprehensive set of parameters.

### **Connection URI Parameters**

#####  Example Configuration

Using the Generic NMSConnectionFactory class would look as follows:

var cf = new NMSConnectionFactory(
    "activemq:tcp://localhost:61616?wireFormat.tightEncodingEnabled=true");

You can also use the ActiveMQ ConecctionFactory implementation directory:

var cf = new Apache.NMS.ActiveMQ.ConnectionFactory(
    "tcp://localhost:61616?wireFormat.tightEncodingEnabled=true");

### Protocol Options

Option Name

Description

tcp

Uses TCP/IP Sockets to connect to the Broker.

ssl

Uses TCP/IP Sockets to connect to the Broker with an added SSL layer.

discovery

Uses The Discovery Transport to find a Broker

failover

Uses the Failover Transport to connect and reconnect to one or more Brokers

#### **Transport Options**

##### **TCP Transport Options**

Option Name

Default

Description

transport.useLogging

false

Log data that is sent across the Transport.

transport.receiveBufferSize

8192

Amount of Data to buffer from the Socket

transport.sendBufferSize

8192

Amount of Data to buffer before writing to the Socket

transport.receiveTimeout

0

Time to wait for more data, zero means wait infinitely

transport.sendTimeout

0

Timeout on sends, 0 means wait forever for completion

transport.requestTimeout

0

Time to wait before a Request Command is considered to have failed

##### Discovery Transport Options

##### Failover Transport Options

Prior to NMS.ActiveMQ v1.4.0 the failover transport options did not use the transport.* prefix.

Option Name

Default

Description

transport.timeout

-1

Time that a send operation blocks before failing.

transport.initialReconnectDelay

10

Time in Milliseconds that the transport waits before attempting to reconnect the first time.

transport.maxReconnectDelay

30000

The max time in Milliseconds that the transport will wait before attempting to reconnect.

transport.backOffMultiplier

2

The amount by which the reconnect delay will be multiplied by if useExponentialBackOff is enabled.

transport.useExponentialBackOff

true

Should the delay between connection attempt grow on each try up to the max reconnect delay.

transport.randomize

true

Should the Uri to connect to be chosen at random from the list of available Uris.

transport.maxReconnectAttempts

0

Maximum number of time the transport will attempt to reconnect before failing (0 means infinite retries)

transport.startupMaxReconnectAttempts

0

Maximum number of time the transport will attempt to reconnect before failing when there has never been a connection made. (0 means infinite retries) **(included in NMS.ActiveMQ v1.5.0+)**

transport.reconnectDelay

10

The delay in milliseconds that the transport waits before attempting a reconnection.

transport.backup

false

Should the Failover transport maintain hot backups.

transport.backupPoolSize

1

If enabled, how many hot backup connections are made.

transport.trackMessages

false

keep a cache of in-flight messages that will flushed to a broker on reconnect

transport.maxCacheSize

256

Number of messages that are cached if trackMessages is enabled.

transport.updateURIsSupported

true

Update the list of known brokers based on BrokerInfo messages sent to the client.

#### **Connection Options**

Connection options can either be set via the connection.* prefix or the nms.* prefix similar to the java client's jms.* prefix settings.

Option Name

Default

Description

connection.AsyncSend

false

Are message sent Asynchronously.

connection.AsyncClose

true

Should the close command be sent Asynchronously

connection.AlwaysSyncSend

false

Causes all messages a Producer sends to be sent Asynchronously.

connection.CopyMessageOnSend

true

Copies the Message objects a Producer sends so that the client can reuse Message objects without affecting an in-flight message.

connection.ProducerWindowSize

0

The ProducerWindowSize is the maximum number of bytes in memory that a producer will transmit to a broker before waiting for acknowledgement messages from the broker that it has accepted the previously sent messages. In other words, this how you configure the producer flow control window that is used for async sends where the client is responsible for managing memory usage. The default value of 0 means no flow control at the client. See also [Producer Flow Control](http://activemq.apache.orgFeatures/Message Dispatching FeaturesFeatures/Message Dispatching Features/Features/Message Dispatching Features/producer-flow-control.md)

connection.useCompression

false

Should message bodies be compressed before being sent.

connection.sendAcksAsync

false

Should message acks be sent asynchronously

connection.messagePrioritySupported

true

Should messages be delivered to the client based on the value of the Message Priority header.

connection.dispatchAsync

false

Should the broker [dispatch messages asynchronously](http://activemq.apache.orgFeatures/Consumer FeaturesFeatures/Consumer Features/Features/Consumer Features/consumer-dispatch-async.md) to the connection's consumers.

connection.watchTopicAdvisories

true

Should the client watch for advisory messages from the broker to track the creation and deletion of temporary destinations.

##### **OpenWire Options**

Option Name

Default

Description

wireFormat.stackTraceEnabled

false

Should the stack trace of exception that occur on the broker be sent to the client? Only used by openwire protocol.

wireFormat.cacheEnabled

false

Should commonly repeated values be cached so that less marshalling occurs? Only used by openwire protocol.

wireFormat.tcpNoDelayEnabled

false

Does not affect the wire format, but provides a hint to the peer that TCP nodelay should be enabled on the communications Socket. Only used by openwire protocol.

wireFormat.sizePrefixDisabled

false

Should serialized messages include a payload length prefix? Only used by openwire protocol.

wireFormat.tightEncodingEnabled

false

Should wire size be optimized over CPU usage? Only used by the openwire protocol.

wireFormat.maxInactivityDuration

30000

The maximum inactivity duration (before which the socket is considered dead) in milliseconds. On some platforms it can take a long time for a socket to appear to die, so we allow the broker to kill connections if they are inactive for a period of time. Use by some transports to enable a keep alive heart beat feature. Set to a value <= 0 to disable inactivity monitoring.

maxInactivityDurationInitalDelay

10000

The initial delay in starting the maximum inactivity checks (and, yes, the word 'Inital' is supposed to be misspelled like that)

### **Destination URI Parameters**

##### Example Configuration

d = session.CreateTopic("com.foo?consumer.prefetchSize=2000&consumer.noLocal=true");

#### **General Options**

Option Name

Default

Description

consumer.prefetchSize

1000

The number of message the consumer will [prefetch](http://activemq.apache.orgCommunity/FAQ/Using Apache ActiveMQCommunity/FAQ/Using Apache ActiveMQ/Community/FAQ/Using Apache ActiveMQ/what-is-the-prefetch-limit-for.md).  **Removed in v1.7.0 use connection prefetch policy instead.**

consumer.maximumPendingMessageLimit

0

Use to control if messages are dropped if a [slow consumer](http://activemq.apache.orgFeatures/Consumer FeaturesFeatures/Consumer Features/Features/Consumer Features/slow-consumer-handling.md) situation exists.

consumer.noLocal

false

Same as the noLocal flag on a Topic consumer. Exposed here so that it can be used with a queue.

consumer.dispatchAsync

false

Should the broker [dispatch messages asynchronously](http://activemq.apache.orgFeatures/Consumer FeaturesFeatures/Consumer Features/Features/Consumer Features/consumer-dispatch-async.md) to the consumer.

consumer.retroactive

false

Is this a [Retroactive Consumer](http://activemq.apache.orgFeatures/Consumer FeaturesFeatures/Consumer Features/Features/Consumer Features/retroactive-consumer.md).

consumer.selector

null

JMS Selector used with the consumer.

consumer.exclusive

false

Is this an [Exclusive Consumer](http://activemq.apache.orgFeatures/Consumer Features/exclusive-consumer.md).

consumer.priority

0

Allows you to configure a [Consumer Priority](http://activemq.apache.orgFeatures/Consumer FeaturesFeatures/Consumer Features/Features/Consumer Features/consumer-priority.md).

#### **OpenWire-only Options**

Option Name

Default

Description

consumer.browser

false

consumer.networkSubscription

false

consumer.optimizedAcknowledge

false

Enables an optimised acknowledgement mode where messages are acknowledged in batches rather than individually. Alternatively, you could use Session.DUPS\_OK\_ACKNOWLEDGE acknowledgement mode for the consumers which can often be faster. **WARNING** enabling this issue could cause some issues with auto-acknowledgement on reconnection

consumer.noRangeAcks

false

consumer.retroactive

false

Sets whether or not retroactive consumers are enabled. Retroactive consumers allow non-durable topic subscribers to receive old messages that were published before the non-durable subscriber started.
