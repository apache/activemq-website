For a\ndescription of MoMs and other messaging concepts please see the Messaging Concepts.\n\n\nWhy use Apache ActiveMQ Artemis? Here are just a few of the reasons:\n\n100% open source software. Apache ActiveMQ Artemis is licensed using the Apache\nSoftware License v 2.0 to minimise barriers to adoption.\n\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis is designed with usability in mind.\n\nWritten in Java. Runs on any platform with a Java 8+ runtime, that's\neverything from Windows desktops to IBM mainframes.\n\nAmazing performance. Our ground-breaking high performance journal\nprovides persistent messaging performance at rates normally seen for\nnon-persistent messaging, our non-persistent messaging performance\nrocks the boat too.\n\nFull feature set. All the features you'd expect in any serious\nmessaging system, and others you won't find anywhere else.\n\nElegant, clean-cut design with minimal third party dependencies. Run\nActiveMQ Artemis stand-alone, run it in integrated in your favourite Java EE\napplication server, or run it embedded inside your own product. It's\nup to you.\n\nSeamless high availability.

Most\nmessaging systems also support a request-response mode but this is not a\nprimary feature of messaging systems.\nDesigning systems to be asynchronous from end-to-end allows you to\nreally take advantage of your hardware resources, minimizing the amount\nof threads blocking on IO operations, and to use your network bandwidth\nto its full capacity. With an RPC approach you have to wait for a\nresponse for each request you make so are limited by the network round\ntrip time, or latency of your network. With an asynchronous system you\ncan pipeline flows of messages in different directions, so are limited\nby the network bandwidth not the latency. This typically allows you to\ncreate much higher performance applications.\nMessaging systems decouple the senders of messages from the consumers of\nmessages. The senders and consumers of messages are completely\nindependent and know nothing of each other. This allows you to create\nflexible, loosely coupled systems.\nOften, large enterprises use a messaging system to implement a message\nbus which loosely couples heterogeneous systems together. Message buses\noften form the core of an Enterprise Service\nBus. (ESB). Using\na message bus to de-couple disparate systems can allow the system to\ngrow and adapt more easily. It also allows more flexibility to add new\nsystems or retire old ones since they don't have brittle dependencies on\neach other.\nMessaging styles\nMessaging systems normally support two main styles of asynchronous\nmessaging: message queue\nmessaging (also known as point-to-point messaging) and publish\nsubscribe messaging.\nWe'll summarise them briefly here:\nThe Message Queue Pattern\nWith this type of messaging you send a message to a queue. The message\nis then typically persisted to provide a guarantee of delivery, then\nsome time later the messaging system delivers the message to a consumer.\nThe consumer then processes the message and when it is done, it\nacknowledges the message. Once the message is acknowledged it disappears\nfrom the queue and is not available to be delivered again. If the system\ncrashes before the messaging server receives an acknowledgement from the\nconsumer, then on recovery, the message will be available to be\ndelivered to a consumer again.\nWith point-to-point messaging, there can be many consumers on the queue\nbut a particular message will only ever be consumed by a maximum of one\nof them. Senders (also known as producers) to the queue are completely\ndecoupled from receivers (also known as consumers) of the queue - they\ndo not know of each other's existence.\nA classic example of point to point messaging would be an order queue in\na company's book ordering system. Each order is represented as a message\nwhich is sent to the order queue. Let's imagine there are many front end\nordering systems which send orders to the order queue. When a message\narrives on the queue it is persisted - this ensures that if the server\ncrashes the order is not lost. Let's also imagine there are many\nconsumers on the order queue - each representing an instance of an order\nprocessing component - these can be on different physical machines but\nconsuming from the same queue. The messaging system delivers each\nmessage to one and only one of the ordering processing components.\nDifferent messages can be processed by different order processors, but a\nsingle order is only processed by one order processor - this ensures\norders aren't processed twice.\nAs an order processor receives a message, it fulfills the order, sends\norder information to the warehouse system and then updates the order\ndatabase with the order details. Once it's done that it acknowledges the\nmessage to tell the server that the order has been processed and can be\nforgotten about. Often the send to the warehouse system, update in\ndatabase and acknowledgement will be completed in a single transaction\nto ensure ACID properties.\nThe Publish-Subscribe Pattern\nWith publish-subscribe messaging many senders can send messages to an\nentity on the server, often called a topic (e.g. in the JMS world).\nThere can be many subscriptions on a topic, a subscription is just\nanother word for a consumer of a topic. Each subscription receives a\ncopy of each message sent to the topic. This differs from the\nmessage queue pattern where each message is only consumed by a single\nconsumer.\nSubscriptions can optionally be durable which means they retain a copy\nof each message sent to the topic until the subscriber consumes them -\neven if the server crashes or is restarted in between. Non-durable\nsubscriptions only last a maximum of the lifetime of the connection that\ncreated them.\nAn example of publish-subscribe messaging would be a news feed. As news\narticles are created by different editors around the world they are sent\nto a news feed topic. There are many subscribers around the world who\nare interested in receiving news items - each one creates a subscription\nand the messaging system ensures that a copy of each news message is\ndelivered to each subscription.\nDelivery guarantees\nA key feature of most messaging systems is reliable messaging. With\nreliable messaging the server gives a guarantee that the message will be\ndelivered once and only once to each consumer of a queue or each durable\nsubscription of a topic, even in the event of system failure. This is\ncrucial for many businesses; e.g. you don't want your orders fulfilled\nmore than once or any of your orders to be lost.\nIn other cases you may not care about a once and only once delivery\nguarantee and are happy to cope with duplicate deliveries or lost\nmessages - an example of this might be transient stock price updates -\nwhich are quickly superseded by the next update on the same stock. The\nmessaging system allows you to configure which delivery guarantees you\nrequire.\nTransactions\nMessaging systems typically support the sending and acknowledgement of\nmultiple messages in a single local transaction. Apache ActiveMQ Artemis also supports\nthe sending and acknowledgement of message as part of a large global\ntransaction - using the Java mapping of XA: JTA.\nDurability\nMessages are either durable or non durable. Durable messages will be\npersisted in permanent storage and will survive server failure or\nrestart. Non durable messages will not survive server failure or\nrestart. Examples of durable messages might be orders or trades, where\nthey cannot be lost. An example of a non durable message might be a\nstock price update which is transitory and doesn't need to survive a\nrestart.\nMessaging APIs and protocols\nHow do client applications interact with messaging systems in order to\nsend and consume messages?\nSeveral messaging systems provide their own proprietary APIs with which\nthe client communicates with the messaging system.\nThere are also some standard ways of operating with messaging systems\nand some emerging standards in this space.\nLet's take a brief look at these:\nJava Message Service (JMS)\nJMS is part of\nOracle's Java EE specification. It's a Java API that encapsulates both message\nqueue and publish-subscribe messaging patterns. JMS is a lowest common\ndenominator specification - i.e. it was created to encapsulate common\nfunctionality of the already existing messaging systems that were\navailable at the time of its creation.\nJMS is a very popular API and is implemented by most messaging systems.\nJMS is only available to clients running Java.\nJMS does not define a standard wire format - it only defines a\nprogrammatic API so JMS clients and servers from different vendors\ncannot directly interoperate since each will use the vendor's own\ninternal wire protocol.\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis provides a fully compliant JMS 1.1 and JMS 2.0 API.\nSystem specific APIs\nMany systems provide their own programmatic API for which to interact\nwith the messaging system. The advantage of this it allows the full set\nof system functionality to be exposed to the client application. API's\nlike JMS are not normally rich enough to expose all the extra features\nthat most messaging systems provide.\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis provides its own core client API for clients to use if they\nwish to have access to functionality over and above that accessible via\nthe JMS API.\nRESTful API\nREST\napproaches to messaging are showing a lot interest recently.\nIt seems plausible that API standards for cloud computing may converge\non a REST style set of interfaces and consequently a REST messaging\napproach is a very strong contender for becoming the de-facto method for\nmessaging interoperability.\nWith a REST approach messaging resources are manipulated as resources\ndefined by a URI and typically using a simple set of operations on those\nresources, e.g. PUT, POST, GET etc. REST approaches to messaging often\nuse HTTP as their underlying protocol.\nThe advantage of a REST approach with HTTP is in its simplicity and the\nfact the internet is already tuned to deal with HTTP optimally.\nPlease see Rest Interface for using Apache ActiveMQ Artemis's RESTful interface.\nAMQP\nAMQP is a specification for\ninteroperable messaging. It also defines a wire format, so any AMQP\nclient can work with any messaging system that supports AMQP. AMQP\nclients are available in many different programming languages.\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis implements the AMQP\n1.0\nspecification. Any client that supports the 1.0 specification will be\nable to interact with Apache ActiveMQ Artemis.\nMQTT\nMQTT is a lightweight connectivity protocol.  It is designed\nto run in environments where device and networks are constrained.  Out of the box\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis supports version MQTT 3.1.1.  Any client supporting this\nversion of the protocol will work against Apache ActiveMQ Artemis.\nSTOMP\nStomp is a very simple text protocol for\ninteroperating with messaging systems. It defines a wire format, so\ntheoretically any Stomp client can work with any messaging system that\nsupports Stomp. Stomp clients are available in many different\nprogramming languages.\nPlease see Stomp for using STOMP with Apache ActiveMQ Artemis.\nOPENWIRE\nActiveMQ 5.x defines it's own wire Protocol \"OPENWIRE\".  In order to support \nActiveMQ 5.x clients, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis supports OPENWIRE.  Any ActiveMQ 5.12.x\nor higher can be used with Apache ActiveMQ Artemis.\nHigh Availability\nHigh Availability (HA) means that the system should remain operational\nafter failure of one or more of the servers. The degree of support for\nHA varies between various messaging systems.\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis provides automatic failover where your sessions are\nautomatically reconnected to the backup server on event of live server\nfailure.\nFor more information on HA, please see High Availability and Failover.\nClusters\nMany messaging systems allow you to create groups of messaging servers\ncalled clusters. Clusters allow the load of sending and consuming\nmessages to be spread over many servers. This allows your system to\nscale horizontally by adding new servers to the cluster.\nDegrees of support for clusters varies between messaging systems, with\nsome systems having fairly basic clusters with the cluster members being\nhardly aware of each other.\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis provides very configurable state-of-the-art clustering model\nwhere messages can be intelligently load balanced between the servers in\nthe cluster, according to the number of consumers on each node, and\nwhether they are ready for messages.\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis also has the ability to automatically redistribute messages\nbetween nodes of a cluster to prevent starvation on any particular node.\nFor full details on clustering, please see Clusters.\nBridges and routing\nSome messaging systems allow isolated clusters or single nodes to be\nbridged together, typically over unreliable connections like a wide area\nnetwork (WAN), or the internet.\nA bridge normally consumes from a queue on one server and forwards\nmessages to another queue on a different server. Bridges cope with\nunreliable connections, automatically reconnecting when the connections\nbecomes available again.\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis bridges can be configured with filter expressions to only\nforward certain messages, and transformation can also be hooked in.\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis also allows routing between queues to be configured in server\nside configuration. This allows complex routing networks to be set up\nforwarding or copying messages from one destination to another, forming\na global network of interconnected brokers.\nFor more information please see Core Bridges and Diverting and Splitting Message Flows.\n"},"architecture.html":{"url":"architecture.html","title":"Architecture","keywords":"","body":"Architecture\nIn this section we will give an overview of the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis high level\narchitecture.\nCore Architecture\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis core is designed simply as set of Plain Old Java Objects\n(POJOs) - we hope you like its clean-cut design.\nEach Apache ActiveMQ Artemis server has its own ultra high performance persistent\njournal, which it uses for message and other persistence.\nUsing a high performance journal allows outrageous persistence message\nperformance, something not achievable when using a relational database\nfor persistence.\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis clients, potentially on different physical machines interact\nwith the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis server. Apache ActiveMQ Artemis currently provides two APIs for\nmessaging at the client side:\n\nCore client API. This is a simple intuitive Java API that is aligned with the Artemis internal Core.  Allowing more\n control of broker objects, like for example, direct creation of addresses and queues.  The Core API also offers a\n full set of messaging functionality without some of the complexities of JMS.\n\nJMS client API. The standard JMS API is available at the client side.\n\n\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis also provides different protocol implementations on the server so you can use respective clients for these protocols:\n\nAMQP\nOpenWire\nMQTT\nSTOMP\nHornetQ (for use with HornetQ clients).\nCORE (Artemis CORE protocol)\n\nJMS semantics are implemented by a JMS facade layer on the client\nside.\nThe Apache ActiveMQ Artemis server does not speak JMS and in fact does not know\nanything about JMS, it is a protocol agnostic messaging server designed\nto be used with multiple different protocols.\nWhen a user uses the JMS API on the client side, all JMS interactions\nare translated into operations on the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis core client API before\nbeing transferred over the wire using the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis wire format.\nThe server always just deals with core API interactions.\nA schematic illustrating this relationship is shown in figure 3.1 below:\n\nFigure 3.1 shows two user applications interacting with an Apache ActiveMQ Artemis\nserver. User Application 1 is using the JMS API, while User Application\n2 is using the core client API directly.\nYou can see from the diagram that the JMS API is implemented by a thin\nfacade layer on the client side.\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis stand-alone server\nThe standard stand-alone messaging server configuration comprises a core\nmessaging server and a number of protocol managers that provide support for\nthe various protocol mentioned earlier.  Protocol managers are plugable\nif you \nThe stand-alone server configuration uses Airline\nfor bootstrapping the Broker.\nThe stand-alone server architecture is shown in figure 3.3 below:\n\nFor more information on server configuration files see Server Configuration\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis embedded in your own application\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis core is designed as a set of simple POJOs so if you have an\napplication that requires messaging functionality internally but you\ndon't want to expose that as an Apache ActiveMQ Artemis server you can directly\ninstantiate and embed Apache ActiveMQ Artemis servers in your own application.\nFor more information on embedding Apache ActiveMQ Artemis, see Embedding Apache ActiveMQ Artemis.\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis integrated with a Java EE application server\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis provides its own fully functional Java Connector Architecture\n(JCA) adaptor which enables it to be integrated easily into any Java EE\ncompliant application server or servlet engine.\nJava EE application servers provide Message Driven Beans (MDBs), which are a\nspecial type of Enterprise Java Beans (EJBs) that can process messages\nfrom sources such as JMS systems or mail systems.\nProbably the most common use of an MDB is to consume messages from a JMS\nmessaging system.\nAccording to the Java EE specification, a Java EE application server uses a JCA\nadapter to integrate with a JMS messaging system so it can consume\nmessages for MDBs.\nHowever, the JCA adapter is not only used by the Java EE application server\nfor consuming messages via MDBs, it is also used when sending message\nto the JMS messaging system e.g. from inside an EJB or servlet.\nWhen integrating with a JMS messaging system from inside a Java EE\napplication server it is always recommended that this is done via a JCA\nadaptor. In fact, communicating with a JMS messaging system directly,\nwithout using JCA would be illegal according to the Java EE specification.\nThe application server's JCA service provides extra functionality such\nas connection pooling and automatic transaction enlistment, which are\ndesirable when using messaging, say, from inside an EJB. It is possible\nto talk to a JMS messaging system directly from an EJB, MDB or servlet\nwithout going through a JCA adapter, but this is not recommended since\nyou will not be able to take advantage of the JCA features, such as\ncaching of JMS sessions, which can result in poor performance.\nFigure 3.2 below shows a Java EE application server integrating with a\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis server via the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis JCA adaptor. Note that all\ncommunication between EJB sessions or entity beans and Message Driven\nbeans go through the adaptor and not directly to Apache ActiveMQ Artemis.\nThe large arrow with the prohibited sign shows an EJB session bean\ntalking directly to the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis server. This is not recommended as\nyou'll most likely end up creating a new connection and session every\ntime you want to interact from the EJB, which is an anti-pattern.\n\n"},"using-server.html":{"url":"using-server.html","title":"Using the Server","keywords":"","body":"Using the Server\nThis chapter will familiarise you with how to use the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis server.\nWe'll show where it is, how to start and stop it, and we'll describe the\ndirectory layout and what all the files are and what they do.\nFor the remainder of this chapter when we talk about the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis server\nwe mean the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis standalone server, in its default configuration\nwith a JMS Service enabled.\nThis document will refer to the full path of the directory where the ActiveMQ\ndistribution has been extracted to as ${ARTEMIS_HOME} directory.\nInstallation\nAfter downloading the distribution, the following highlights some important folders on the distribution:\n         |___ bin\n         |\n         |___ web\n         |      |___ user-manual\n         |      |___ api\n         |\n         |___ examples\n         |      |___ core\n         |      |___ javaee\n         |      |___ jms\n         |\n         |___ lib\n         |\n         |___ schema\n\nbin -- binaries and scripts needed to run ActiveMQ Artemis.\n\nweb -- The folder where the web context is loaded when ActiveMQ Artemis runs.\n\nuser-manual -- The user manual is placed under the web folder.\n\napi -- The api documentation is placed under the web folder\n\nexamples -- JMS and Java EE examples.

Example:\n/var/lib/mybroker/bin/artemis stop\nPlease note that Apache ActiveMQ Artemis requires a Java 7 or later runtime to run.\nBy default the etc/bootstrap.xml configuration is\nused. The configuration can be changed e.g. by running\n./artemis run -- xml:path/to/bootstrap.xml or another\nconfig of your choosing.\nEnvironment variables are used to provide ease of changing ports, hosts and\ndata directories used and can be found in etc/artemis.profile on linux and\netc\\artemis.profile.cmd on Windows.\nServer JVM settings\nThe run scripts set some JVM settings for tuning the garbage collection\npolicy and heap size. We recommend using a parallel garbage collection\nalgorithm to smooth out latency and minimise large GC pauses.\nBy default Apache ActiveMQ Artemis runs in a maximum of 1GiB of RAM. To increase the\nmemory settings change the -Xms and -Xmx memory settings as you\nwould for any Java program.\nIf you wish to add any more JVM arguments or tune the existing ones, the\nrun scripts are the place to do it.\nPre-configured Options\nThe distribution contains several standard configuration sets for\nrunning:\n\nNon clustered stand-alone.\n\nClustered stand-alone\n\nReplicated stand-alone\n\nShared-store stand-alone\n\n\nYou can of course create your own configuration and specify any\nconfiguration when running the run script.\nLibrary Path\nIf you're using the Asynchronous IO Journal on Linux,\nyou need to specify java.library.path as a property on your Java\noptions. This is done automatically in the scripts.\nIf you don't specify java.library.path at your Java options then the\nJVM will use the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH.\nYou will need to make sure libaio is installed on Linux. For more information refer to the libaio chapter at\nRuntime Dependencies\nSystem properties\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis can take a system property on the command line for configuring\nlogging.\nFor more information on configuring logging, please see the section on\nLogging.\nConfiguration files\nThe configuration file used to bootstrap the server (e.g.\nbootstrap.xml by default) references the specific broker configuration\nfiles.\n\nbroker.xml. This is the main ActiveMQ\nconfiguration file. All the parameters in this file are\ndescribed here\n\nIt is also possible to use system property substitution in all the\nconfiguration files. by replacing a value with the name of a system\nproperty. Here is an example of this with a connector configuration:\ntcp://${activemq.remoting.netty.host:localhost}:${activemq.remoting.netty.port:61616}\nHere you can see we have replaced 2 values with system properties\nactivemq.remoting.netty.host and activemq.remoting.netty.port. These\nvalues will be replaced by the value found in the system property if\nthere is one, if not they default back to localhost or 61616\nrespectively. It is also possible to not supply a default. i.e.\n${activemq.remoting.netty.host}, however the system property must be\nsupplied in that case.\nBootstrap File\nThe stand-alone server is basically a set of POJOs which are\ninstantiated by Airline commands.\nThe bootstrap file is very simple. Let's take a look at an example:\n\n\n   \n\n   \n\n\n\ncore - Instantiates a core server using the configuration file from the\nconfiguration attribute. This is the main broker POJO necessary to\ndo all the real messaging work.  In addition all JMS objects such as:\nQueues, Topics and ConnectionFactory instances are configured here.\n\nThe main configuration file.\nThe configuration for the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis core server is contained in\nbroker.xml. This is what the FileConfiguration bean\nuses to configure the messaging server.\nThere are many attributes which you can configure Apache ActiveMQ Artemis. In most\ncases the defaults will do fine, in fact every attribute can be\ndefaulted which means a file with a single empty configuration element\nis a valid configuration file. The different configuration will be\nexplained throughout the manual or you can refer to the configuration\nreference here.\nWindows Server\nOn windows you will have the option to run ActiveMQ Artemis as a service.\nJust use the following command to install it:\n $ ./artemis-service.exe install\nThe create process should give you a hint of the available commands available for the artemis-service.exe\n"},"address-model.html":{"url":"address-model.html","title":"Address Model","keywords":"","body":"Apache ActiveMQ Artemis Addressing and Queues\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis has a unique addressing model that is both powerful and flexible and that offers great performance. The addressing model comprises three main concepts: addresses, queues and routing types.\nAn address represents a messaging endpoint. Within the configuration, a typical address is given a unique name, 0 or more queues, and a routing type.\nA queue is associated with an address. There can be multiple queues per address. Once an incoming message is matched to an address, the message will be sent on to one or more of its queues, depending on the routing type configured. Queues can be configured to be automatically created and deleted.\nA routing type determines how messages are sent to the queues associated with an address. An Apache ActiveMQ Artemis address can be configured with two different routing types.\nTable 1. Routing Types\n\n\n\nIf you want your messages routed to…​\nUse this routing type …​\n\n\n\n\nA single queue within the matching address, in a point-to-point manner.\nAnycast\n\n\nEvery queue within the matching address, in a publish-subscribe manner.\nMulticast\n\n\n\n\nNote: It is possible to define more than one routing type per address, but this typically results in an anti-pattern and is therefore not recommended.  If an address does use both routing types, however, and the client does not show a preference for either one, the broker typically defaults to the anycast routing type.\nThe one exception is when the client uses the MQTT protocol. In that case, the default routing type is multicast. |\nBasic Address Configuration\nThe following examples show how to configure basic point to point and publish subscribe addresses.\nPoint-to-Point Messaging\nPoint-to-point messaging is a common scenario in which a message sent by a producer has only one consumer. AMQP and JMS message producers and consumers can make use of point-to-point messaging queues, for example. Define an anycast routing type for an address so that its queues receive messages in a point-to-point manner.\nWhen a message is received on an address using anycast, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis locates the queue associated with the address and routes the message to it. When consumers request to consume from the address, the broker locates the relevant queue and associates this queue with the appropriate consumers. If multiple consumers are connected to the same queue, messages are distributed amongst each consumer equally, providing the consumers are equally able to handle them.\n\nFigure 1. Point to Point Messaging\nConfiguring an Address to Use the Anycast Routing Type\nOpen the file /etc/broker.xml for editing.\nAdd an address configuration element and its associated queue if they do not exist already.\nNote For normal Point to Point semantics, the queue name MUST match the address name.\n\n  \n    ...\n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\nPublish-Subscribe Messaging\nIn a publish-subscribe scenario, messages are sent to every consumer subscribed to an address. JMS topics and MQTT subscriptions are two examples of publish-subscribe messaging.\nTo configure an address with publish-subscribe semantics, create an address with the multicast routing type.\n\nFigure 2. Publish-Subscribe\nConfiguring an Address to Use the Multicast Routing Type\nOpen the file /etc/broker.xml for editing.\nAdd an address configuration element with multicast routing type.\n\n  \n    ...\n    \n      \n    \n  \n\n\nWhen clients connect to an address with the multicast element, a subscription queue for the client will be automatically created for the client. It is also possible to pre-configure subscription queues and connect to them directly using the queue's Fully Qualified Queue names.\nOptionally add one or more queue elements to the address and wrap the multicast element around them. This step is typically not needed since the broker will automatically create a queue for each subscription requested by a client.\n\n  \n    ...\n    \n      \n        \n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\nFigure 3. Point-to-Point with Two Queues\nPoint-to-Point Address multiple Queues\nIt is actually possible to define more than one queue on an address with an anycast routing type. When messages are received on such an address, they are firstly distributed evenly across all the defined queues. Using Fully Qualified Queue names, clients are able to select the queue that they would like to subscribe to. Should more than one consumer connect direct to a single queue, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis will take care of distributing messages between them, as in the example above.\n\nFigure 3. Point-to-Point with Two Queues\n\nNote: This is how Apache ActiveMQ Artemis handles load balancing of queues across multiple nodes in a cluster.\nConfiguring a Point-to-Point Address with two queues, open the file /etc/broker.xml for editing.\nAdd an address configuration with Anycast routing type element and its associated queues.\n\n  \n    ...\n    \n      \n        \n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\nPoint-to-Point and Publish-Subscribe Addresses\nIt is possible to define an address with both point-to-point and publish-subscribe semantics enabled. While not typically recommend, this can be useful when you want, for example, a JMS Queue say orders and a JMS Topic named orders. The different routing types make the addresses appear to be distinct.\nUsing an example of JMS Clients, the messages sent by a JMS message producer will be routed using the anycast routing type. Messages sent by a JMS topic producer will use the multicast routing type. In addition when a JMS topic consumer attaches, it will be attached to it’s own subscription queue. JMS queue consumer will be attached to the anycast queue.\n\nFigure 4. [Point-to-Point and Publish-Subscribe\n\nNote: The behavior in this scenario is dependent on the protocol being used. For JMS there is a clear distinction between topic and queue producers and consumers, which make the logic straight forward. Other protocols like AMQP do not make this distinction. A message being sent via AMQP will be routed by both anycast and multicast and consumers will default to anycast. For more information, please check the behavior of each protocol in the sections on protocols.\nThe XML snippet below is an example of what the configuration for an address using both anycast and multicast would look like in /etc/broker.xml. Note that subscription queues are typically created on demand, so there is no need to list specific queue elements inside the multicast routing type.\n\n  \n    ...\n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n\nHow to filter messages\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis supports the ability to filter messages using Apache Artemis Filter Expressions.\nFilters can be applied in two places, on a queue and on a consumer.\nQueue Filter\nWhen a filter is applied to a queue, messages are filter before they sent to the queue.  To add a queue filter use the\nfilter element when configuring a queue.  Open up the broker.xml and add an address with a queue, using the filter element\nto configure a filter on this queue.\n    \n       \n          \n        \n    \n\nThe filter defined above ensures that only messages with an attribute \"color='red'\" is sent to this queue.\nConsumer Filters\nConsumer filters are applied after messages have reached a queue and are defined using the appropriate client APIs.  The\nfollow JMS example shows how to consumer filters work.\n\nDefine an address with a single queue, with no filter applied.\n\n    \n       \n       \n    \n\n  ...\n  // Send some messages\n  for (int i = 0; i \nAt this point the queue would have 6 messages: red,green,red,green,red,green\n  MessageConsumer redConsumer = redSession.createConsumer(queue, \"color='red'\");\n\nThe redConsumer has a filter that only matches \"red\" messages.  The redConsumer will receive 3 messages.\nred, red, red\nThe resulting queue would now be\ngreen, green, green\nCreating and Deleting Addresses and Queues Automatically\nYou can configure Apache ActiveMQ Artemis to automatically create addresses and queues, and then delete them when they are no longer in use. This saves you from having to preconfigure each address and queue before a client can connect to it. Automatic creation and deletion is configured on a per address basis and is controlled by following:\n\n\n\nParameter\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nauto-create-addresses\nWhen set to true, the broker will create the address requested by the client if it does not exist already. The default is true.\n\n\nauto-delete-addresses\nWhen set to true, the broker will be delete any auto-created adddress once all of it’s queues have been deleted. The default is true\n\n\ndefault-address-routing-type\nThe routing type to use if the client does not specify one.   Possible values are MULTICAST and ANYCAST. See earlier in this chapter for more information about routing types. The default value is MULTICAST.\n\n\n\nConfiguring an Address to be Automatically Created\nEdit the file /etc/broker.xml and add the auto-create-addresses element to the address-setting you want the broker to automatically create.\n(Optional) Add the address-setting if it does not exits. Use the match parameter and the The Apache ActiveMQ Artemis Wildcard Syntax to match more than one specific address.\nSet auto-create-addresses to true\n(Optional) Assign MULTICAST or ANYCAST as the default routing type for the address.\nThe example below configures an address-setting to be automatically created by the broker. The default routing type to be used if not specified by the client is MULTICAST. Note that wildcard syntax is used. Any address starting with /news/politics/ will be automatically created by the broker.\n\n  \n    ...\n    \n       \n          true\n          MULTICAST\n       \n    \n    ...\n  \n\n\nConfiguring an Address to be Automatically Deleted\nEdit the file /etc/broker.xml and add the auto-delete-addresses element to the address-setting you want the broker to automatically create.\n(Optional) Add the address-setting if it does not exits. Use the match parameter and the The Apache ActiveMQ Artemis Wildcard Syntax to match more than one specific address.\nSet auto-delete-addresses to true\nThe example below configures an address-setting to be automatically deleted by the broker. Note that wildcard syntax is used. Any address request by the client that starts with /news/politics/ is configured to be automatically deleted by the broker.\n\n  \n    ...\n    \n       \n          true\n          MULTICAST\n       \n    \n    ...\n  \n\n\nFully Qualified Queue Names\nInternally the broker maps a client’s request for an address to specific queues. The broker decides on behalf of the client which queues to send messages to or from which queue to receive messages. However, more advanced use cases might require that the client specify a queue directly. In these situations the client and use a fully qualified queue name, by specifying both the address name and the queue name, separated by a ::.\nCurrently Artemis supports fully qualified queue names on Core, AMQP, JMS, OpenWire, MQTT and Stomp protocols for \n receiving messages only.\nSpecifying a Fully Qualified Queue Name\nIn this example, the address foo is configured with two queues q1, q2 as shown in the configuration below.\n\n  \n    ...\n    \n       \n          \n             \n             \n          \n       \n    \n  \n\n\nIn the client code, use both the address name and the queue name when requesting a connection from the broker. Remember to use two colons, ::, to separate the names, as in the example Java code below.\nString FQQN = \"foo::q1\";\nQueue q1 session.createQueue(FQQN);\nMessageConsumer consumer = session.createConsumer(q1);\n\nConfiguring a Prefix to Connect to a Specific Routing Type\nNormally, if a Apache ActiveMQ Artemis receivs a message sent to a particular address, that has both anycast and multicast routing types enable, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis will route a copy of the message to one of the anycast queues and to all of the multicast queues.\nHowever, clients can specify a special prefix when connecting to an address to specify whether to connect using anycast or multicast. The prefixes are custom values that are designated using the anycastPrefix and multicastPrefix parameters within the URL of an acceptor.\nConfiguring an Anycast Prefix\nIn /etc/broker.xml, add the anycastPrefix to the URL of the desired acceptor. In the example below, the acceptor is configured to use anycast:// for the anycastPrefix. Client code can specify anycast://foo/ if the client needs to send a message to only one of the anycast queues.\n\n  \n    ...\n      \n         tcp://0.0.0.0:61616?protocols=AMQP;anycastPrefix=anycast://\n      \n    ...\n  \n\n\nConfiguring a Multicast Prefix\nIn /etc/broker.xml, add the anycastPrefix to the URL of the desired acceptor. In the example below, the acceptor is configured to use multicast:// for the multicastPrefix. Client code can specify multicast://foo/ if the client needs the message sent to only the multicast queues of the address.\n\n  \n    ...\n      \n         tcp://0.0.0.0:61616?protocols=AMQP;multicastPrefix=multicast://\n      \n    ...\n  \n\n\nAdvanced Address Configuration\nPre-configuring subscription queue semantics\nIn most cases it’s not necessary to pre-create subscription queues. The relevant protocol managers take care of creating subscription queues when clients request to subscribe to an address.  The type of subscription queue created, depends on what properties the client request.  E.g. durable, non-shared, shared etc...  Protocol managers uses special queue names to identify which queues below to which consumers and users need not worry about the details.\nHowever, there are scenarios where a user may want to use broker side configuration to pre-configure a subscription.  And later connect to that queue directly using a Fully Qualified Queue name.  The examples below show how to use broker side configuration to pre-configure a queue with publish subscribe behavior for shared, non-shared, durable and non-durable subscription behavior.\nConfiguring a shared durable subscription queue with up to 10 concurrent consumers\nThe default behavior for queues is to not limit the number connected queue consumers.  The max-consumers parameter of the queue element can be used to limit the number of connected consumers allowed at any one time.\nOpen the file /etc/broker.xml for editing.\n\n  \n    ...\n    \n      \n        \n        \n          true\n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\nConfiguring a non-shared durable subscription\nThe broker can be configured to prevent more than one consumer from connecting to a queue at any one time. The subscriptions to queues configured this way are therefore \"non-shared\".  To do this simply set the max-consumers parameter to \"1\"\n\n  \n    ...\n    \n      \n        \n        \n          true\n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\nPre-configuring a queue as a non-durable subscription queue\nNon-durable subscriptions are again usually managed by the relevant protocol manager, by creating and deleting temporary queues.\nIf a user requires to pre-create a queue that behaves like a non-durable subscription queue the purge-on-no-consumers flag can be enabled on the queue.  When purge-on-no-consumers is set to true.  The queue will not start receiving messages until a consumer is attached.  When the last consumer is detached from the queue.  The queue is purged (it's messages are removed) and will not receive any more messages until a new consumer is attached.\nOpen the file /etc/broker.xml for editing.\n\n  \n    ...\n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\nAdditional Information: Protocol Managers, Address\nA protocol manager maps protocol specific concepts down to the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis core model of addresses, queues and routing types. For example, when a client sends a MQTT subscription packet with the addresses \n/house/room1/lights\n/house/room2/lights\nThe MQTT protocol manager understands that the two addresses require multicast semantics. The protocol manager will therefore first look to ensure that multicast is enabled for both addresses. If not, it will attempt to dynamically create them. If successful, the protocol manager will then create special subscription queues with special names, for each subscription requested by the client.\nThe special name allows the protocol manager to quickly identify the required client subscription queues should the client disconnect and reconnect at a later date.  If the subscription is temporary the protocol manager will delete the queue once the client disconnects.  \nWhen a client requests to subscribe to a point to point address.  The protocol manager will look up the queue associated with the point to point address.  This queue should have the same name as the addresss.\nNote: If the queue is auto created, it will be auto deleted once there are no consumers and no messages in it.  For more information on auto create see the next section Configuring Addresses and Queues via Address Settings\nConfiguring Addresses and Queues via Address Settings\nThere are some attributes that are defined against an address wildcard\nrather than a specific address/queue. Here an example of an address-setting\nentry that would be found in the broker.xml file.\n\n   \n      DLA\n      3\n      5000\n      ExpiryQueue\n      true\n      100000\n      20000\n      0\n      true\n      PAGE\n      -1\n      NOTIFY\n      5\n   \n\nThe idea with address settings, is you can provide a block of settings\nwhich will be applied against any addresses that match the string in the\nmatch attribute. In the above example the settings would only be\napplied to the address \"order.foo\" address but you can also use wildcards\nto apply settings.  See: The chapter on the wild card syntax.\nFor example, if you used the match string queue.# the settings\nwould be applied to all addresses which start with queue.\nThe meaning of the specific settings are explained fully throughout the\nuser manual, however here is a brief description with a link to the\nappropriate chapter if available.\nmax-delivery-attempts defines how many time a cancelled message can be\nredelivered before sending to the dead-letter-address. A full\nexplanation can be found here.\nredelivery-delay defines how long to wait before attempting redelivery\nof a cancelled message. see here.\nexpiry-address defines where to send a message that has expired. see\nhere.\nexpiry-delay defines the expiration time that will be used for\nmessages which are using the default expiration time (i.e. 0). For\nexample, if expiry-delay is set to \"10\" and a message which is using\nthe default expiration time (i.e. 0) arrives then its expiration time of\n\"0\" will be changed to \"10.\" However, if a message which is using an\nexpiration time of \"20\" arrives then its expiration time will remain\nunchanged. Setting expiry-delay to \"-1\" will disable this feature. The\ndefault is \"-1\".\nlast-value-queue defines whether a queue only uses last values or not.\nsee here.\nmax-size-bytes and page-size-bytes are used to set paging on an\naddress. This is explained here.\nredistribution-delay defines how long to wait when the last consumer\nis closed on a queue before redistributing any messages. see\nhere.\nsend-to-dla-on-no-route. If a message is sent to an address, but the\nserver does not route it to any queues, for example, there might be no\nqueues bound to that address, or none of the queues have filters that\nmatch, then normally that message would be discarded. However if this\nparameter is set to true for that address, if the message is not routed\nto any queues it will instead be sent to the dead letter address (DLA)\nfor that address, if it exists.\naddress-full-policy. This attribute can have one of the following\nvalues: PAGE, DROP, FAIL or BLOCK and determines what happens when an\naddress where max-size-bytes is specified becomes full. The default\nvalue is PAGE. If the value is PAGE then further messages will be paged\nto disk. If the value is DROP then further messages will be silently\ndropped. If the value is FAIL then further messages will be dropped and\nan exception will be thrown on the client-side. If the value is BLOCK\nthen client message producers will block when they try and send further\nmessages. See the following chapters for more info Flow Control, Paging.\nslow-consumer-threshold.

If you are completely new to JMS we suggest\nyou follow the Oracle JMS tutorial -\na full JMS tutorial is out of scope for this guide.\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis also ships with a wide range of examples, many of which\ndemonstrate JMS API usage. A good place to start would be to play around\nwith the simple JMS Queue and Topic example, but we also provide\nexamples for many other parts of the JMS API. A full description of the\nexamples is available in Examples.\nIn this section we'll go through the main steps in configuring the\nserver for JMS and creating a simple JMS program. We'll also show how to\nconfigure and use JNDI, and also how to use JMS with Apache ActiveMQ Artemis without\nusing any JNDI.\nA simple ordering system\nFor this chapter we're going to use a very simple ordering system as our\nexample. It is a somewhat contrived example because of its extreme\nsimplicity, but it serves to demonstrate the very basics of setting up\nand using JMS.\nWe will have a single JMS Queue called OrderQueue, and we will have a\nsingle MessageProducer sending an order message to the queue and a\nsingle MessageConsumer consuming the order message from the queue.\nThe queue will be a durable queue, i.e. it will survive a server\nrestart or crash. We also want to pre-deploy the queue, i.e. specify the\nqueue in the server configuration so it is created automatically\nwithout us having to explicitly create it from the client.\nJNDI Configuration\nThe JMS specification establishes the convention that administered\nobjects (i.e. JMS queue, topic and connection factory instances) are\nmade available via the JNDI API. Brokers are free to implement JNDI as\nthey see fit assuming the implementation fits the API. Apache ActiveMQ Artemis does not\nhave a JNDI server. Rather, it uses a client-side JNDI implementation\nthat relies on special properties set in the environment to construct\nthe appropriate JMS objects. In other words, no objects are stored in\nJNDI on the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis server, instead they are simply instantiated on the\nclient based on the provided configuration. Let's look at the different\nkinds of administered objects and how to configure them.\n\nNote\nThe following configuration properties are strictly required when\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis is running in stand-alone mode. When Apache ActiveMQ Artemis is integrated\nto an application server (e.g. Wildfly) the application server itself\nwill almost certainly provide a JNDI client with its own properties.\n\nConnectionFactory JNDI\nA JMS connection factory is used by the client to make connections to\nthe server. It knows the location of the server it is connecting to, as\nwell as many other configuration parameters.\nHere's a simple example of the JNDI context environment for a client\nlooking up a connection factory to access an embedded instance of\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis:\njava.naming.factory.initial=org.apache.activemq.artemis.jndi.ActiveMQInitialContextFactory\nconnectionFactory.invmConnectionFactory=vm://0\nIn this instance we have created a connection factory that is bound to\ninvmConnectionFactory, any entry with prefix connectionFactory. will\n  create a connection factory.\nIn certain situations there could be multiple server instances running\nwithin a particular JVM. In that situation each server would typically\nhave an InVM acceptor with a unique server-ID. A client using JMS and\nJNDI can account for this by specifying a connction factory for each\nserver, like so:\njava.naming.factory.initial=org.apache.activemq.artemis.jndi.ActiveMQInitialContextFactory\nconnectionFactory.invmConnectionFactory0=vm://0\nconnectionFactory.invmConnectionFactory1=vm://1\nconnectionFactory.invmConnectionFactory2=vm://2\nHere is a list of all the supported URL schemes:\n\nvm\n\ntcp\n\nudp\n\njgroups\n\n\nMost clients won't be connecting to an embedded broker. Clients will\nmost commonly connect across a network a remote broker. Here's a simple\nexample of a client configuring a connection factory to connect to a\nremote broker running on myhost:5445:\njava.naming.factory.initial=org.apache.activemq.artemis.jndi.ActiveMQInitialContextFactory\nconnectionFactory.ConnectionFactory=tcp://myhost:5445\nIn the example above the client is using the tcp scheme for the\nprovider URL. A client may also specify multiple comma-delimited\nhost:port combinations in the URL (e.g.\n(tcp://remote-host1:5445,remote-host2:5445)). Whether there is one or\nmany host:port combinations in the URL they are treated as the initial\nconnector(s) for the underlying connection.\nThe udp scheme is also supported which should use a host:port\ncombination that matches the group-address and group-port from the\ncorresponding broadcast-group configured on the ActiveMQ Artemis server(s).\nEach scheme has a specific set of properties which can be set using the\ntraditional URL query string format (e.g.\nscheme://host:port?key1=value1&key2=value2) to customize the\nunderlying transport mechanism. For example, if a client wanted to\nconnect to a remote server using TCP and SSL it would create a connection\nfactory like so, tcp://remote-host:5445?ssl-enabled=true.\nAll the properties available for the tcp scheme are described in the\ndocumentation regarding the Netty\ntransport.\nNote if you are using the tcp scheme and multiple addresses then a query\ncan be applied to all the url's or just to an individual connector, so where\nyou have\n\n(tcp://remote-host1:5445?httpEnabled=true,remote-host2:5445?httpEnabled=true)?clientID=1234\n\nthen the httpEnabled property is only set on the individual connectors where as the clientId\nis set on the actual connection factory. Any connector specific properties set on the whole\nURI will be applied to all the connectors.\nThe udp scheme supports 4 properties:\n\nlocalAddress - If you are running with multiple network\ninterfaces on the same machine, you may want to specify that the\ndiscovery group listens only only a specific interface. To do this\nyou can specify the interface address with this parameter.\n\nlocalPort - If you want to specify a local port to which the\ndatagram socket is bound you can specify it here. Normally you would\njust use the default value of -1 which signifies that an anonymous\nport should be used. This parameter is always specified in\nconjunction with localAddress.\n\nrefreshTimeout - This is the period the discovery group waits\nafter receiving the last broadcast from a particular server before\nremoving that servers connector pair entry from its list. You would\nnormally set this to a value significantly higher than the\nbroadcast-period on the broadcast group otherwise servers might\nintermittently disappear from the list even though they are still\nbroadcasting due to slight differences in timing. This parameter is\noptional, the default value is 10000 milliseconds (10 seconds).\n\ndiscoveryInitialWaitTimeout - If the connection factory is used\nimmediately after creation then it may not have had enough time to\nreceived broadcasts from all the nodes in the cluster. On first\nusage, the connection factory will make sure it waits this long\nsince creation before creating the first connection. The default\nvalue for this parameter is 10000 milliseconds.\n\n\nLastly, the jgroups scheme is supported which provides an alternative\nto the udp scheme for server discovery. The URL pattern is either\njgroups://channelName?file=jgroups-xml-conf-filename\nwherejgroups-xml-conf-filename refers to an XML file on the classpath\nthat contains the JGroups configuration or it can be\njgroups://channelName?properties=some-jgroups-properties. In both instance the\nchannelName is the name given to the jgroups channel created.\nThe refreshTimeout and discoveryInitialWaitTimeout properties\nare supported just like with udp.\nThe default type for the default connection factory is of type javax.jms.ConnectionFactory.\nThis can be changed by setting the type like so\njava.naming.factory.initial=org.apache.activemq.artemis.jndi.ActiveMQInitialContextFactory\njava.naming.provider.url=tcp://localhost:5445?type=CF\nIn this example it is still set to the default, below shows a list of types that can be set.\nConfiguration for Connection Factory Types\n\n\n\ntype\ninterface\n\n\n\n\nCF (default)\njavax.jms.ConnectionFactory\n\n\nXA_CF\njavax.jms.XAConnectionFactory\n\n\nQUEUE_CF\njavax.jms.QueueConnectionFactory\n\n\nQUEUE_XA_CF\njavax.jms.XAQueueConnectionFactory\n\n\nTOPIC_CF\njavax.jms.TopicConnectionFactory\n\n\nTOPIC_XA_CF\njavax.jms.XATopicConnectionFactory\n\n\n\nDestination JNDI\nJMS destinations are also typically looked up via JNDI. As with\nconnection factories, destinations can be configured using special\nproperties in the JNDI context environment. The property name should\nfollow the pattern: queue. or topic..\nThe property value should be the name of the queue hosted by the\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis server. For example, if the server had a JMS queue configured\nlike so:\n\nAnd if the client wanted to bind this queue to \"queues/OrderQueue\" then\nthe JNDI properties would be configured like so:\njava.naming.factory.initial=org.apache.activemq.artemis.jndi.ActiveMQInitialContextFactory\njava.naming.provider.url=tcp://myhost:5445\nqueue.queues/OrderQueue=OrderQueue\nIt is also possible to look-up JMS destinations which haven't been\nconfigured explicitly in the JNDI context environment. This is possible\nusing dynamicQueues/ or dynamicTopics/ in the look-up string. For\nexample, if the client wanted to look-up the aforementioned \"OrderQueue\"\nit could do so simply by using the string \"dynamicQueues/OrderQueue\".\nNote, the text that follows dynamicQueues/ or dynamicTopics/ must\ncorrespond exactly to the name of the destination on the server.\nThe code\nHere's the code for the example:\nFirst we'll create a JNDI initial context from which to lookup our JMS\nobjects. If the above properties are set in jndi.properties and it is\non the classpath then any new, empty InitialContext will be\ninitialized using those properties:\nInitialContext ic = new InitialContext();\n\n//Now we'll look up the connection factory from which we can create\n//connections to myhost:5445:\n\nConnectionFactory cf = (ConnectionFactory)ic.lookup(\"ConnectionFactory\");\n\n//And look up the Queue:\n\nQueue orderQueue = (Queue)ic.lookup(\"queues/OrderQueue\");\n\n//Next we create a JMS connection using the connection factory:\n\nConnection connection = cf.createConnection();\n\n//And we create a non transacted JMS Session, with AUTO\\_ACKNOWLEDGE\n//acknowledge mode:\n\nSession session = connection.createSession(false, Session.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE);\n\n//We create a MessageProducer that will send orders to the queue:\n\nMessageProducer producer = session.createProducer(orderQueue);\n\n//And we create a MessageConsumer which will consume orders from the\n//queue:\n\nMessageConsumer consumer = session.createConsumer(orderQueue);\n\n//We make sure we start the connection, or delivery won't occur on it:\n\nconnection.start();\n\n//We create a simple TextMessage and send it:\n\nTextMessage message = session.createTextMessage(\"This is an order\");\nproducer.send(message);\n\n//And we consume the message:\n\nTextMessage receivedMessage = (TextMessage)consumer.receive();\nSystem.out.println(\"Got order: \" + receivedMessage.getText());\n\nIt is as simple as that. For a wide range of working JMS examples please\nsee the examples directory in the distribution.\n\nWarning\nPlease note that JMS connections, sessions, producers and consumers\nare designed to be re-used.\nIt is an anti-pattern to create new connections, sessions, producers\nand consumers for each message you produce or consume. If you do this,\nyour application will perform very poorly. This is discussed further\nin the section on performance tuning Performance Tuning.\n\nDirectly instantiating JMS Resources without using JNDI\nAlthough it is a very common JMS usage pattern to lookup JMS\nAdministered Objects (that's JMS Queue, Topic and ConnectionFactory\ninstances) from JNDI, in some cases you just think \"Why do I need JNDI?\nWhy can't I just instantiate these objects directly?\"\nWith Apache ActiveMQ Artemis you can do exactly that. Apache ActiveMQ Artemis supports the direct\ninstantiation of JMS Queue, Topic and ConnectionFactory instances, so\nyou don't have to use JNDI at all.\n\nFor a full working example of direct instantiation please look at the\n\"Instantiate JMS Objects Directly\" example under the JMS section of the\nexamples.  See the Examples section for more info.\n\nHere's our simple example, rewritten to not use JNDI at all:\nWe create the JMS ConnectionFactory object via the ActiveMQJMSClient\nUtility class, note we need to provide connection parameters and specify\nwhich transport we are using, for more information on connectors please\nsee Configuring the Transport.\nTransportConfiguration transportConfiguration = new TransportConfiguration(NettyConnectorFactory.class.getName());\n\nConnectionFactory cf = ActiveMQJMSClient.createConnectionFactoryWithoutHA(JMSFactoryType.CF,transportConfiguration);\n\n//We also create the JMS Queue object via the ActiveMQJMSClient Utility\n//class:\n\nQueue orderQueue = ActiveMQJMSClient.createQueue(\"OrderQueue\");\n\n//Next we create a JMS connection using the connection factory:\n\nConnection connection = cf.createConnection();\n\n//And we create a non transacted JMS Session, with AUTO\\_ACKNOWLEDGE\n//acknowledge mode:\n\nSession session = connection.createSession(false, Session.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE);\n\n//We create a MessageProducer that will send orders to the queue:\n\nMessageProducer producer = session.createProducer(orderQueue);\n\n//And we create a MessageConsumer which will consume orders from the\n//queue:\n\nMessageConsumer consumer = session.createConsumer(orderQueue);\n\n//We make sure we start the connection, or delivery won't occur on it:\n\nconnection.start();\n\n//We create a simple TextMessage and send it:\n\nTextMessage message = session.createTextMessage(\"This is an order\");\nproducer.send(message);\n\n//And we consume the message:\n\nTextMessage receivedMessage = (TextMessage)consumer.receive();\nSystem.out.println(\"Got order: \" + receivedMessage.getText());\n\nSetting The Client ID\nThis represents the client id for a JMS client and is needed for\ncreating durable subscriptions. It is possible to configure this on the\nconnection factory and can be set via the clientId element. Any\nconnection created by this connection factory will have this set as its\nclient id.\nSetting The Batch Size for DUPS_OK\nWhen the JMS acknowledge mode is set to DUPS_OK it is possible to\nconfigure the consumer so that it sends acknowledgements in batches\nrather that one at a time, saving valuable bandwidth. This can be\nconfigured via the connection factory via the dupsOkBatchSize\nelement and is set in bytes. The default is 1024 * 1024 bytes = 1 MiB.\nSetting The Transaction Batch Size\nWhen receiving messages in a transaction it is possible to configure the\nconsumer to send acknowledgements in batches rather than individually\nsaving valuable bandwidth. This can be configured on the connection\nfactory via the transactionBatchSize element and is set in bytes.\nThe default is 1024 * 1024.\nSetting The Destination Cache\nMany frameworks such as Spring resolve the destination by name on every operation,\nthis can cause a performance issue and extra calls to the broker, \nin a scenario where destinations (addresses) are permanent broker side, \nsuch as they are managed by a platform or operations team.\nusing destinationCache element, you can toggle on the destination cache \nto improve the performance and reduce the calls to the broker.\nThis should not be used if destinations (addresses) are not permanent broker side, \nas in dynamic creation/deletion.\n"},"using-core.html":{"url":"using-core.html","title":"Using Core","keywords":"","body":"Using Core\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis core is a completely JMS-agnostic messaging system with its own\nAPI. We call this the core API.\nIf you don't want to use JMS or other protocols you can use the core API directly. The core\nAPI provides all the functionality of JMS but without much of the\ncomplexity. It also provides features that are not available using JMS.\nCore Messaging Concepts\nSome of the core messaging concepts are similar to JMS concepts, but\ncore messaging concepts differ in some ways. In general the core\nmessaging API is simpler than the JMS API, since we remove distinctions\nbetween queues, topics and subscriptions. We'll discuss each of the\nmajor core messaging concepts in turn, but to see the API in detail,\nplease consult the Javadoc.\nMessage\n\nA message is the unit of data which is sent between clients and\nservers.\n\nA message has a body which is a buffer containing convenient methods\nfor reading and writing data into it.\n\nA message has a set of properties which are key-value pairs. Each\nproperty key is a string and property values can be of type integer,\nlong, short, byte, byte[], String, double, float or boolean.\n\nA message has an address it is being sent to. When the message\narrives on the server it is routed to any queues that are bound to\nthe address - if the queues are bound with any filter, the message\nwill only be routed to that queue if the filter matches. An address\nmay have many queues bound to it or even none. There may also be\nentities other than queues, like diverts bound to addresses.\n\nMessages can be either durable or non durable. Durable messages in a\ndurable queue will survive a server crash or restart. Non durable\nmessages will never survive a server crash or restart.\n\nMessages can be specified with a priority value between 0 and 9. 0\nrepresents the lowest priority and 9 represents the highest.\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis will attempt to deliver higher priority messages before\nlower priority ones.\n\nMessages can be specified with an optional expiry time. Apache ActiveMQ Artemis\nwill not deliver messages after its expiry time has been exceeded.\n\nMessages also have an optional timestamp which represents the time\nthe message was sent.\n\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis also supports the sending/consuming of very large messages\nmuch larger than can fit in available RAM at any one time.\n\n\nAddress\nA server maintains a mapping between an address and a set of queues.\nZero or more queues can be bound to a single address. Each queue can be\nbound with an optional message filter. When a message is routed, it is\nrouted to the set of queues bound to the message's address. If any of\nthe queues are bound with a filter expression, then the message will\nonly be routed to the subset of bound queues which match that filter\nexpression.\nOther entities, such as diverts can also be bound to an address and\nmessages will also be routed there.\n\nNote\nIn core, there is no concept of a Topic, Topic is a JMS only term.\nInstead, in core, we just deal with addresses and queues.\nFor example, a JMS topic would be implemented by a single address to\nwhich many queues are bound. Each queue represents a subscription of\nthe topic. A JMS Queue would be implemented as a single address to\nwhich one queue is bound - that queue represents the JMS queue.\n\nQueue\nQueues can be durable, meaning the messages they contain survive a\nserver crash or restart, as long as the messages in them are durable.\nNon durable queues do not survive a server restart or crash even if the\nmessages they contain are durable.\nQueues can also be temporary, meaning they are automatically deleted\nwhen the client connection is closed, if they are not explicitly deleted\nbefore that.\nQueues can be bound with an optional filter expression. If a filter\nexpression is supplied then the server will only route messages that\nmatch that filter expression to any queues bound to the address.\nMany queues can be bound to a single address. A particular queue is only\nbound to a maximum of one address.\nServerLocator\nClients use ServerLocator instances to create ClientSessionFactory\ninstances. ServerLocator instances are used to locate servers and\ncreate connections to them.\nIn JMS terms think of a ServerLocator in the same way you would a JMS\nConnection Factory.\nServerLocator instances are created using the ActiveMQClient factory\nclass.\nClientSessionFactory\nClients use ClientSessionFactory instances to create ClientSession\ninstances. ClientSessionFactory instances are basically the connection\nto a server\nIn JMS terms think of them as JMS Connections.\nClientSessionFactory instances are created using the ServerLocator\nclass.\nClientSession\nA client uses a ClientSession for consuming and producing messages and\nfor grouping them in transactions. ClientSession instances can support\nboth transactional and non transactional semantics and also provide an\nXAResource interface so messaging operations can be performed as part\nof a\nJTA\ntransaction.\nClientSession instances group ClientConsumers and ClientProducers.\nClientSession instances can be registered with an optional\nSendAcknowledgementHandler. This allows your client code to be\nnotified asynchronously when sent messages have successfully reached the\nserver. This unique Apache ActiveMQ Artemis feature, allows you to have full guarantees\nthat sent messages have reached the server without having to block on\neach message sent until a response is received. Blocking on each\nmessages sent is costly since it requires a network round trip for each\nmessage sent. By not blocking and receiving send acknowledgements\nasynchronously you can create true end to end asynchronous systems which\nis not possible using the standard JMS API. For more information on this\nadvanced feature please see the section Guarantees of sends and commits.\nClientConsumer\nClients use ClientConsumer instances to consume messages from a queue.\nCore Messaging supports both synchronous and asynchronous message\nconsumption semantics. ClientConsumer instances can be configured with\nan optional filter expression and will only consume messages which match\nthat expression.\nClientProducer\nClients create ClientProducer instances on ClientSession instances\nso they can send messages. ClientProducer instances can specify an\naddress to which all sent messages are routed, or they can have no\nspecified address, and the address is specified at send time for the\nmessage.\n\nWarning\nPlease note that ClientSession, ClientProducer and ClientConsumer\ninstances are designed to be re-used.\nIt's an anti-pattern to create new ClientSession, ClientProducer and\nClientConsumer instances for each message you produce or consume. If\nyou do this, your application will perform very poorly. This is\ndiscussed further in the section on performance tuning Performance Tuning.\n\nA simple example of using Core\nHere's a very simple program using the core messaging API to send and\nreceive a message. Logically it's comprised of two sections: firstly\nsetting up the producer to write a message to an addresss, and\nsecondly, creating a queue for the consumer, creating the consumer and\nstarting it.\nServerLocator locator = ActiveMQClient.createServerLocatorWithoutHA(new TransportConfiguration(\n                                           InVMConnectorFactory.class.getName()));\n\n// In this simple example, we just use one session for both producing and receiving\n\nClientSessionFactory factory =  locator.createClientSessionFactory();\nClientSession session = factory.createSession();\n\n// A producer is associated with an address ...\n\nClientProducer producer = session.createProducer(\"example\");\nClientMessage message = session.createMessage(true);\nmessage.getBodyBuffer().writeString(\"Hello\");\n\n// We need a queue attached to the address ...\n\nsession.createQueue(\"example\", \"example\", true);\n\n// And a consumer attached to the queue ...\n\nClientConsumer consumer = session.createConsumer(\"example\");\n\n// Once we have a queue, we can send the message ...\n\nproducer.send(message);\n\n// We need to start the session before we can -receive- messages ...\n\nsession.start();\nClientMessage msgReceived = consumer.receive();\n\nSystem.out.println(\"message = \" + msgReceived.getBodyBuffer().readString());\n\nsession.close();\n\n"},"using-AMQP.html":{"url":"using-AMQP.html","title":"Using AMQP","keywords":"","body":"Using AMQP\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis is also a pure AMQP 1.0 broker, with a high performant and feature complete protocol manager for AMQP.\nYou can use any AMQP 1.0 compatible clients.\nA short list includes:\n\nqpid clients at the qpid project\n.NET Clients\nJavascript NodeJS\nJava Script RHEA\n\n... and many others.\nMessage Conversions\nThe broker will not perform any message conversion to any other protocols when sending AMQP and receiving AMQP.\nHowever if you intend your message to be received on a AMQP JMS Client, you must follow the JMS Mapping convention:\n\nJMS Mapping Conventions\n\nIf you send a body type that is not recognized by this specification the conversion between AMQP and any other protocol will make it a Binary Message.\nSo, make sure you follow these conventions if you intend to cross protocols or languages.

We try not to re-encode (or even decode) messages.\n\nIf regardless these recommendations you still need and want to intercept and change AMQP Messages, look at the example under ./examples/features/standard/broker-plugin.\nThis example will send AMQP Message and modify properties before they reach the journals and are sent to the consumers.\n"},"jms-core-mapping.html":{"url":"jms-core-mapping.html","title":"Mapping JMS Concepts to the Core API","keywords":"","body":"Mapping JMS Concepts to the Core API\nThis chapter describes how JMS destinations are mapped to Apache ActiveMQ Artemis\naddresses.\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis core is JMS-agnostic. It does not have any concept of a JMS\ntopic. A JMS topic is implemented in core as an address with name=(the topic name) \nand with a MULTICAST routing type with zero or more queues bound to it. Each queue bound to that address\nrepresents a topic subscription. \nLikewise, a JMS queue is implemented as an address with name=(the JMS queue name) with an ANYCAST routing type assocatied\nwith it.\nNote.  That whilst it is possible to configure a JMS topic and queue with the same name, it is not a recommended\nconfiguration for use with cross protocol. \n"},"client-classpath.html":{"url":"client-classpath.html","title":"The Client Classpath","keywords":"","body":"The Client Classpath\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis requires just a single jar on the client classpath.\n\nWarning\nThe client jar mentioned here can be found in the lib/client directory of the\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis distribution.

Examples are split\n by the following source tree:\n\nfeatures - Examples containing broker specific features.\nha - examples showing failover and reconnection capabilities.\nclustered - examples showing load balancing and distribution capabilities.\nperf - examples allowing you to run a few performance tests on the server\nsub-modules - examples of integrated external modules.\n\n\nprotocols - Protocol specific examples\nopenwire\nmqtt\nstomp\namqp\n\n\n\nA set of Java EE examples are also provided which need WildFly installed to be able to run.\nRunning the Examples\nTo run any example, simply cd into the appropriate example directory and type mvn verify or mvn install (For \ndetails please read the readme.html in each example directory).\nYou can use the profile -Pexamples to run multiple examples under any example tree.\nFor each server, you will have a created server under ./target/server0 (some examples use more than one server).\nYou have the option to prevent the example from starting the server (e.g. if you want to start the server manually) by \nsimply specifying the -PnoServer profile, e.g.:\n# running an example without running the server\nmvn verify -PnoServer\n\nAlso under ./target there will be a script repeating the commands to create each server. Here is the create-server0.sh\ngenerated by the Queue example. This is useful to see exactly what command(s) are required to configure the server(s).\n# These are the commands used to create server0\n/myInstallDirectory/apache-artemis-1.1.0/bin/artemis create --allow-anonymous --silent --force --no-web --user guest --password guest --role guest --port-offset 0 --data ./data --allow-anonymous --no-autotune --verbose /myInstallDirectory/apache-artemis-1.1.0/examples/features/standard/queue/target/server0\n\nSeveral examples use UDP clustering which may not work in your environment by default. On linux the command would be:\nroute add -net 224.0.0.0 netmask 240.0.0.0 dev lo\n\nThis command should be run as root. This will redirect any traffic directed to 224.0.0.0 to the loopback interface.\nOn Mac OS X, the command is slightly different:\nsudo route add 224.0.0.0 127.0.0.1 -netmask 240.0.0.0\n\nAll the examples use the Maven plugin, which can be useful for running your test servers as well.\nThis is the common output when running an example.

Please refer to the distribution for a more accurate list.\nApplet\nThis example shows you how to send and receive JMS messages from an Applet.\nApplication-Layer Failover\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis also supports Application-Layer failover, useful in the case\nthat replication is not enabled on the server side.\nWith Application-Layer failover, it's up to the application to register\na JMS ExceptionListener with Apache ActiveMQ Artemis which will be called by Apache ActiveMQ Artemis\nin the event that connection failure is detected.\nThe code in the ExceptionListener then recreates the JMS connection,\nsession, etc on another node and the application can continue.\nApplication-layer failover is an alternative approach to High\nAvailability (HA). Application-layer failover differs from automatic\nfailover in that some client side coding is required in order to\nimplement this. Also, with Application-layer failover, since the old\nsession object dies and a new one is created, any uncommitted work in\nthe old session will be lost, and any unacknowledged messages might be\nredelivered.\nCore Bridge Example\nThe bridge example demonstrates a core bridge deployed on one server,\nwhich consumes messages from a local queue and forwards them to an\naddress on a second server.\nCore bridges are used to create message flows between any two Apache ActiveMQ Artemis\nservers which are remotely separated. Core bridges are resilient and\nwill cope with temporary connection failure allowing them to be an ideal\nchoice for forwarding over unreliable connections, e.g. a WAN.\nBrowser\nThe browser example shows you how to use a JMS QueueBrowser with\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis.\nQueues are a standard part of JMS, please consult the JMS 2.0\nspecification for full details.\nA QueueBrowser is used to look at messages on the queue without\nremoving them. It can scan the entire content of a queue or only\nmessages matching a message selector.\nClient Kickoff\nThe client-kickoff example shows how to terminate client connections\ngiven an IP address using the JMX management API.\nClient side failover listener\nThe client-side-failoverlistener example shows how to register a\nlistener to monitor failover events\nClient-Side Load-Balancing\nThe client-side-load-balancing example demonstrates how sessions\ncreated from a single JMS Connection can be created to different nodes\nof the cluster. In other words it demonstrates how Apache ActiveMQ Artemis does\nclient-side load-balancing of sessions across the cluster.\nClustered Durable Subscription\nThis example demonstrates a clustered JMS durable subscription\nClustered Grouping\nThis is similar to the message grouping example except that it\ndemonstrates it working over a cluster. Messages sent to different nodes\nwith the same group id will be sent to the same node and the same\nconsumer.\nClustered Queue\nThe clustered-queue example demonstrates a queue deployed on two\ndifferent nodes. The two nodes are configured to form a cluster. We then\ncreate a consumer for the queue on each node, and we create a producer\non only one of the nodes. We then send some messages via the producer,\nand we verify that both consumers receive the sent messages in a\nround-robin fashion.\nClustering with JGroups\nThe clustered-jgroups example demonstrates how to form a two node\ncluster using JGroups as its underlying topology discovery technique,\nrather than the default UDP broadcasting. We then create a consumer for\nthe queue on each node, and we create a producer on only one of the\nnodes. We then send some messages via the producer, and we verify that\nboth consumers receive the sent messages in a round-robin fashion.\nClustered Standalone\nThe clustered-standalone example demonstrates how to configure and\nstarts 3 cluster nodes on the same machine to form a cluster. A\nsubscriber for a JMS topic is created on each node, and we create a\nproducer on only one of the nodes. We then send some messages via the\nproducer, and we verify that the 3 subscribers receive all the sent\nmessages.\nClustered Static Discovery\nThis example demonstrates how to configure a cluster using a list of\nconnectors rather than UDP for discovery\nClustered Static Cluster One Way\nThis example demonstrates how to set up a cluster where cluster\nconnections are one way, i.e. server A -> Server B -> Server C\nClustered Topic\nThe clustered-topic example demonstrates a JMS topic deployed on two\ndifferent nodes. The two nodes are configured to form a cluster. We then\ncreate a subscriber on the topic on each node, and we create a producer\non only one of the nodes. We then send some messages via the producer,\nand we verify that both subscribers receive all the sent messages.\nMessage Consumer Rate Limiting\nWith Apache ActiveMQ Artemis you can specify a maximum consume rate at which a JMS\nMessageConsumer will consume messages. This can be specified when\ncreating or deploying the connection factory.\nIf this value is specified then Apache ActiveMQ Artemis will ensure that messages are\nnever consumed at a rate higher than the specified rate. This is a form\nof consumer throttling.\nDead Letter\nThe dead-letter example shows you how to define and deal with dead\nletter messages. Messages can be delivered unsuccessfully (e.g. if the\ntransacted session used to consume them is rolled back).\nSuch a message goes back to the JMS destination ready to be redelivered.\nHowever, this means it is possible for a message to be delivered again\nand again without any success and remain in the destination, clogging\nthe system.\nTo prevent this, messaging systems define dead letter messages: after a\nspecified unsuccessful delivery attempts, the message is removed from\nthe destination and put instead in a dead letter destination where they\ncan be consumed for further investigation.\nDelayed Redelivery\nThe delayed-redelivery example demonstrates how Apache ActiveMQ Artemis can be\nconfigured to provide a delayed redelivery in the case a message needs\nto be redelivered.\nDelaying redelivery can often be useful in the case that clients\nregularly fail or roll-back. Without a delayed redelivery, the system\ncan get into a \"thrashing\" state, with delivery being attempted, the\nclient rolling back, and delivery being re-attempted in quick\nsuccession, using up valuable CPU and network resources.\nDivert\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis diverts allow messages to be transparently \"diverted\" or copied\nfrom one address to another with just some simple configuration defined\non the server side.\nDurable Subscription\nThe durable-subscription example shows you how to use a durable\nsubscription with Apache ActiveMQ Artemis. Durable subscriptions are a standard part of\nJMS, please consult the JMS 1.1 specification for full details.\nUnlike non-durable subscriptions, the key function of durable\nsubscriptions is that the messages contained in them persist longer than\nthe lifetime of the subscriber - i.e. they will accumulate messages sent\nto the topic even if there is no active subscriber on them. They will\nalso survive server restarts or crashes. Note that for the messages to\nbe persisted, the messages sent to them must be marked as durable\nmessages.\nEmbedded\nThe embedded example shows how to embed JMS within your own code using\nPOJO instantiation and no config files.\nEmbedded Simple\nThe embedded example shows how to embed JMS within your own code using\nregular Apache ActiveMQ Artemis XML files.\nMessage Expiration\nThe expiry example shows you how to define and deal with message\nexpiration. Messages can be retained in the messaging system for a\nlimited period of time before being removed. JMS specification states\nthat clients should not receive messages that have been expired (but it\ndoes not guarantee this will not happen).\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis can assign an expiry address to a given queue so that when\nmessages are expired, they are removed from the queue and sent to the\nexpiry address. These \"expired\" messages can later be consumed from the\nexpiry address for further inspection.\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis Resource Adapter example\nThis examples shows how to build the activemq resource adapters a rar\nfor deployment in other Application Server's\nHTTP Transport\nThe http-transport example shows you how to configure Apache ActiveMQ Artemis to use\nthe HTTP protocol as its transport layer.\nInstantiate JMS Objects Directly\nUsually, JMS Objects such as ConnectionFactory, Queue and Topic\ninstances are looked up from JNDI before being used by the client code.\nThis objects are called \"administered objects\" in JMS terminology.\nHowever, in some cases a JNDI server may not be available or desired. To\ncome to the rescue Apache ActiveMQ Artemis also supports the direct instantiation of\nthese administered objects on the client side so you don't have to use\nJNDI for JMS.\nInterceptor\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis allows an application to use an interceptor to hook into the\nmessaging system. Interceptors allow you to handle various message\nevents in Apache ActiveMQ Artemis.\nJAAS\nThe jaas example shows you how to configure Apache ActiveMQ Artemis to use JAAS for\nsecurity. Apache ActiveMQ Artemis can leverage JAAS to delegate user authentication and\nauthorization to existing security infrastructure.\nJMS Auto Closable\nThe jms-auto-closeable example shows how JMS resources, such as\nconnections, sessions and consumers, in JMS 2 can be automatically\nclosed on error.\nJMS Completion Listener\nThe jms-completion-listener example shows how to send a message\nasynchronously to Apache ActiveMQ Artemis and use a CompletionListener to be notified\nof the Broker receiving it.\nJMS Bridge\nThe jms-bridge example shows how to setup a bridge between two\nstandalone Apache ActiveMQ Artemis servers.\nJMS Context\nThe jms-context example shows how to send and receive a message to/from an\naddress/queue using Apache ActiveMQ Artemis by using a JMS Context.\nA JMSContext is part of JMS 2.0 and combines the JMS Connection and\nSession Objects into a simple Interface.\nJMS Shared Consumer\nThe jms-shared-consumer example shows you how can use shared consumers\nto share a subscription on a topic. In JMS 1.1 this was not allowed and\nso caused a scalability issue. In JMS 2 this restriction has been lifted\nso you can share the load across different threads and connections.\nJMX Management\nThe jmx example shows how to manage Apache ActiveMQ Artemis using JMX.\nLarge Message\nThe large-message example shows you how to send and receive very large\nmessages with Apache ActiveMQ Artemis. Apache ActiveMQ Artemis supports the sending and receiving of\nhuge messages, much larger than can fit in available RAM on the client\nor server. Effectively the only limit to message size is the amount of\ndisk space you have on the server.\nLarge messages are persisted on the server so they can survive a server\nrestart. In other words Apache ActiveMQ Artemis doesn't just do a simple socket stream\nfrom the sender to the consumer.\nLast-Value Queue\nThe last-value-queue example shows you how to define and deal with\nlast-value queues. Last-value queues are special queues which discard\nany messages when a newer message with the same value for a well-defined\nlast-value property is put in the queue. In other words, a last-value\nqueue only retains the last value.\nA typical example for last-value queue is for stock prices, where you\nare only interested by the latest price for a particular stock.\nManagement\nThe management example shows how to manage Apache ActiveMQ Artemis using JMS Messages\nto invoke management operations on the server.\nManagement Notification\nThe management-notification example shows how to receive management\nnotifications from Apache ActiveMQ Artemis using JMS messages. Apache ActiveMQ Artemis servers emit\nmanagement notifications when events of interest occur (consumers are\ncreated or closed, addresses are created or deleted, security\nauthentication fails, etc.).\nMessage Counter\nThe message-counters example shows you how to use message counters to\nobtain message information for a queue.\nMessage Group\nThe message-group example shows you how to configure and use message\ngroups with Apache ActiveMQ Artemis. Message groups allow you to pin messages so they\nare only consumed by a single consumer. Message groups are sets of\nmessages that has the following characteristics:\n\nMessages in a message group share the same group id, i.e. they have\nsame JMSXGroupID string property values\n\nThe consumer that receives the first message of a group will receive\nall the messages that belongs to the group\n\n\nMessage Group\nThe message-group2 example shows you how to configure and use message\ngroups with Apache ActiveMQ Artemis via a connection factory.\nMessage Priority\nMessage Priority can be used to influence the delivery order for\nmessages.\nIt can be retrieved by the message's standard header field 'JMSPriority'\nas defined in JMS specification version 1.1.\nThe value is of type integer, ranging from 0 (the lowest) to 9 (the\nhighest). When messages are being delivered, their priorities will\neffect their order of delivery. Messages of higher priorities will\nlikely be delivered before those of lower priorities.\nMessages of equal priorities are delivered in the natural order of their\narrival at their destinations. Please consult the JMS 1.1 specification\nfor full details.\nMultiple Failover\nThis example demonstrates how to set up a live server with multiple\nbackups\nMultiple Failover Failback\nThis example demonstrates how to set up a live server with multiple\nbackups but forcing failover back to the original live server\nNo Consumer Buffering\nBy default, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis consumers buffer messages from the server in a\nclient side buffer before you actually receive them on the client side.\nThis improves performance since otherwise every time you called\nreceive() or had processed the last message in a\nMessageListener onMessage() method, the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis client would have to\ngo the server to request the next message, which would then get sent to\nthe client side, if one was available.\nThis would involve a network round trip for every message and reduce\nperformance. Therefore, by default, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis pre-fetches messages into a\nbuffer on each consumer.\nIn some case buffering is not desirable, and Apache ActiveMQ Artemis allows it to be\nswitched off. This example demonstrates that.\nNon-Transaction Failover With Server Data Replication\nThe non-transaction-failover example demonstrates two servers coupled\nas a live-backup pair for high availability (HA), and a client using a\nnon-transacted JMS session failing over from live to backup when the\nlive server is crashed.\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis implements failover of client connections between live and\nbackup servers. This is implemented by the replication of state between\nlive and backup nodes. When replication is configured and a live node\ncrashes, the client connections can carry and continue to send and\nconsume messages. When non-transacted sessions are used, once and only\nonce message delivery is not guaranteed and it is possible that some\nmessages will be lost or delivered twice.\nOpenWire\nThe Openwire example shows how to configure an Apache ActiveMQ Artemis server to\ncommunicate with an Apache ActiveMQ Artemis JMS client that uses open-wire protocol.\nYou will find the queue example for open wire, and the chat example.\nPaging\nThe paging example shows how Apache ActiveMQ Artemis can support huge queues even\nwhen the server is running in limited RAM. It does this by transparently\npaging messages to disk, and depaging them when they are required.\nPre-Acknowledge\nStandard JMS supports three acknowledgement modes:AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE, CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE, and\nDUPS_OK_ACKNOWLEDGE. For a full description on these modes please\nconsult the JMS specification, or any JMS tutorial.\nAll of these standard modes involve sending acknowledgements from the\nclient to the server. However in some cases, you really don't mind\nlosing messages in event of failure, so it would make sense to\nacknowledge the message on the server before delivering it to the\nclient. This example demonstrates how Apache ActiveMQ Artemis allows this with an extra\nacknowledgement mode.\nMessage Producer Rate Limiting\nThe producer-rte-limit example demonstrates how, with Apache ActiveMQ Artemis, you\ncan specify a maximum send rate at which a JMS message producer will\nsend messages.\nQueue\nA simple example demonstrating a queue.\nMessage Redistribution\nThe queue-message-redistribution example demonstrates message\nredistribution between queues with the same name deployed in different\nnodes of a cluster.\nQueue Requestor\nA simple example demonstrating a JMS queue requestor.\nQueue with Message Selector\nThe queue-selector example shows you how to selectively consume\nmessages using message selectors with queue consumers.\nReattach Node example\nThe Reattach Node example shows how a client can try to reconnect to\nthe same server instead of failing the connection immediately and\nnotifying any user ExceptionListener objects. Apache ActiveMQ Artemis can be configured\nto automatically retry the connection, and reattach to the server when\nit becomes available again across the network.\nReplicated Failback example\nAn example showing how failback works when using replication, In this\nexample a live server will replicate all its Journal to a backup server\nas it updates it. When the live server crashes the backup takes over\nfrom the live server and the client reconnects and carries on from where\nit left off.\nReplicated Failback static example\nAn example showing how failback works when using replication, but this\ntime with static connectors\nReplicated multiple failover example\nAn example showing how to configure multiple backups when using\nreplication\nReplicated Failover transaction example\nAn example showing how failover works with a transaction when using\nreplication\nRequest-Reply example\nA simple example showing the JMS request-response pattern.\nScheduled Message\nThe scheduled-message example shows you how to send a scheduled\nmessage to an address/queue with Apache ActiveMQ Artemis. Scheduled messages won't get\ndelivered until a specified time in the future.\nSecurity\nThe security example shows you how configure and use role based queue\nsecurity with Apache ActiveMQ Artemis.\nSend Acknowledgements\nThe send-acknowledgements example shows you how to use Apache ActiveMQ Artemis's\nadvanced asynchronous send acknowledgements feature to obtain\nacknowledgement from the server that sends have been received and\nprocessed in a separate stream to the sent messages.\nSpring Integration\nThis example shows how to use embedded JMS using Apache ActiveMQ Artemis's Spring\nintegration.\nSSL Transport\nThe ssl-enabled shows you how to configure SSL with Apache ActiveMQ Artemis to send\nand receive message.\nStatic Message Selector\nThe static-selector example shows you how to configure an Apache ActiveMQ Artemis core\nqueue with static message selectors (filters).\nStatic Message Selector Using JMS\nThe static-selector-jms example shows you how to configure an Apache ActiveMQ Artemis\nqueue with static message selectors (filters) using JMS.\nStomp\nThe stomp example shows you how to configure an Apache ActiveMQ Artemis server to send\nand receive Stomp messages.\nStomp1.1\nThe stomp example shows you how to configure an Apache ActiveMQ Artemis server to send\nand receive Stomp messages via a Stomp 1.1 connection.\nStomp1.2\nThe stomp example shows you how to configure an Apache ActiveMQ Artemis server to send\nand receive Stomp messages via a Stomp 1.2 connection.\nStomp Over Web Sockets\nThe stomp-websockets example shows you how to configure an Apache ActiveMQ Artemis\nserver to send and receive Stomp messages directly from Web browsers\n(provided they support Web Sockets).\nSymmetric Cluster\nThe symmetric-cluster example demonstrates a symmetric cluster set-up\nwith Apache ActiveMQ Artemis.\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis has extremely flexible clustering which allows you to set-up\nservers in many different topologies. The most common topology that\nyou'll perhaps be familiar with if you are used to application server\nclustering is a symmetric cluster.\nWith a symmetric cluster, the cluster is homogeneous, i.e. each node is\nconfigured the same as every other node, and every node is connected to\nevery other node in the cluster.\nTemporary Queue\nA simple example demonstrating how to use a JMS temporary queue.\nTopic\nA simple example demonstrating a JMS topic.\nTopic Hierarchy\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis supports topic hierarchies. With a topic hierarchy you can\nregister a subscriber with a wild-card and that subscriber will receive\nany messages sent to an address that matches the wild card.\nTopic Selector 1\nThe topic-selector-example1 example shows you how to send message to a\nJMS Topic, and subscribe them using selectors with Apache ActiveMQ Artemis.\nTopic Selector 2\nThe topic-selector-example2 example shows you how to selectively\nconsume messages using message selectors with topic consumers.\nTransaction Failover\nThe transaction-failover example demonstrates two servers coupled as a\nlive-backup pair for high availability (HA), and a client using a\ntransacted JMS session failing over from live to backup when the live\nserver is crashed.\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis implements failover of client connections between live and\nbackup servers. This is implemented by the sharing of a journal between\nthe servers. When a live node crashes, the client connections can carry\nand continue to send and consume messages. When transacted sessions are\nused, once and only once message delivery is guaranteed.\nFailover Without Transactions\nThe stop-server-failover example demonstrates failover of the JMS\nconnection from one node to another when the live server crashes using a\nJMS non-transacted session.\nTransactional Session\nThe transactional example shows you how to use a transactional Session\nwith Apache ActiveMQ Artemis.\nXA Heuristic\nThe xa-heuristic example shows you how to make an XA heuristic\ndecision through Apache ActiveMQ Artemis Management Interface. A heuristic decision is\na unilateral decision to commit or rollback an XA transaction branch\nafter it has been prepared.\nXA Receive\nThe xa-receive example shows you how message receiving behaves in an\nXA transaction in Apache ActiveMQ Artemis.\nXA Send\nThe xa-send example shows you how message sending behaves in an XA\ntransaction in Apache ActiveMQ Artemis.\n"},"wildcard-routing.html":{"url":"wildcard-routing.html","title":"Routing Messages With Wild Cards","keywords":"","body":"Routing Messages With Wild Cards\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis allows the routing of messages via wildcard addresses.\nIf a queue is created with an address of say queue.news.# then it will\nreceive any messages sent to addresses that match this, for instance\nqueue.news.europe or queue.news.usa or queue.news.usa.sport.

For documentation on JMS selector syntax\nplease the JMS javadoc for\njavax.jms.Message.\nFilter expressions are used in several places in Apache ActiveMQ Artemis\n\nPredefined Queues. When pre-defining a queue, in\nbroker.xml in either the core or jms configuration a filter\nexpression can be defined for a queue. Only messages that match the\nfilter expression will enter the queue.\n\nCore bridges can be defined with an optional filter expression, only\nmatching messages will be bridged (see Core Bridges).\n\nDiverts can be defined with an optional filter expression, only\nmatching messages will be diverted (see Diverts).\n\nFilter are also used programmatically when creating consumers,\nqueues and in several places as described in management.\n\n\nThere are some differences between JMS selector expressions and Apache ActiveMQ Artemis\ncore filter expressions. Whereas JMS selector expressions operate on a\nJMS message, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis core filter expressions operate on a core message.\nThe following identifiers can be used in a core filter expressions to\nrefer to attributes of the core message in an expression:\n\nAMQPriority. To refer to the priority of a message. Message\npriorities are integers with valid values from 0 - 9. 0 is the\nlowest priority and 9 is the highest. E.g.\nAMQPriority = 3 AND animal = 'aardvark'\n\nAMQExpiration. To refer to the expiration time of a message. The\nvalue is a long integer.\n\nAMQDurable. To refer to whether a message is durable or not. The\nvalue is a string with valid values: DURABLE or NON_DURABLE.\n\nAMQTimestamp. The timestamp of when the message was created. The\nvalue is a long integer.\n\nAMQSize. The size of a message in bytes. The value is an integer.\n\n\nAny other identifiers used in core filter expressions will be assumed to\nbe properties of the message.\nThe JMS spec states that a String property should not get converted to a \nnumeric when used in a selector. So for example, if a message has the age \nproperty set to String 21 then the following selector should not match \nit: age > 18. Since Apache ActiveMQ Artemis supports STOMP clients which\ncan only send messages with string properties, that restriction is a bit \nlimiting. Therefore, if you want your filter expressions to auto-convert String \nproperties the the appropriate number type, just prefix it with\nconvert_string_expressions:. If you changed the filter expression in the\nprevious example to be convert_string_expressions:age > 18, then it would \nmatch the aforementioned message.\nThe JMS spec also states that property identifiers (and therefore the\nidentifiers which are valid for use in a filter expression) are an, \n\"unlimited-length sequence of letters and digits, the first of which must be\na letter. A letter is any character for which the method \nCharacter.isJavaLetter returns true. This includes _ and $. A letter\nor digit is any character for which the method Character.isJavaLetterOrDigit\nreturns true.\" This constraint means that hyphens (i.e. -) cannot be used.\nHowever, this constraint can be overcome by using the hyphenated_props: \nprefix. For example, if a message had the foo-bar property set to 0 then\nthe filter expression hyphenated_props:foo-bar = 0 would match it.\n"},"persistence.html":{"url":"persistence.html","title":"Persistence","keywords":"","body":"Persistence\nIn this chapter we will describe how persistence works with Apache ActiveMQ Artemis and\nhow to configure it.\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis ships with two persistence options.  The Apache ActiveMQ Artemis File journal\nwhich is highly optimized for the messaging use case and gives great performance, and also Apache Artemis\nJDBC Store, which uses JDBC to connect to a database of your choice.  The JDBC Store is still under development,\nbut it is possible to use it's journal features, (essentially everything except for paging and large messages).\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis File Journal (Default)\nAn Apache ActiveMQ Artemis file journal is an append only journal. It consists of a set of\nfiles on disk. Each file is pre-created to a fixed size and initially\nfilled with padding. As operations are performed on the server, e.g. add\nmessage, update message, delete message, records are appended to the\njournal. When one journal file is full we move to the next one.\nBecause records are only appended, i.e. added to the end of the journal\nwe minimise disk head movement, i.e. we minimise random access\noperations which is typically the slowest operation on a disk.\nMaking the file size configurable means that an optimal size can be\nchosen, i.e. making each file fit on a disk cylinder. Modern disk\ntopologies are complex and we are not in control over which cylinder(s)\nthe file is mapped onto so this is not an exact science. But by\nminimising the number of disk cylinders the file is using, we can\nminimise the amount of disk head movement, since an entire disk cylinder\nis accessible simply by the disk rotating - the head does not have to\nmove.\nAs delete records are added to the journal, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis has a sophisticated\nfile garbage collection algorithm which can determine if a particular\njournal file is needed any more - i.e. has all its data been deleted in\nthe same or other files. If so, the file can be reclaimed and re-used.\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis also has a compaction algorithm which removes dead space from\nthe journal and compresses up the data so it takes up less files on\ndisk.\nThe journal also fully supports transactional operation if required,\nsupporting both local and XA transactions.\nThe majority of the journal is written in Java, however we abstract out\nthe interaction with the actual file system to allow different pluggable\nimplementations. Apache ActiveMQ Artemis ships with two implementations:\n\nJava NIO.\nThe first implementation uses standard Java NIO to interface with\nthe file system. This provides extremely good performance and runs\non any platform where there's a Java 6+ runtime.\n\nLinux Asynchronous IO\nThe second implementation uses a thin native code wrapper to talk to\nthe Linux asynchronous IO library (AIO). With AIO, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis will be\ncalled back when the data has made it to disk, allowing us to avoid\nexplicit syncs altogether and simply send back confirmation of\ncompletion when AIO informs us that the data has been persisted.\nUsing AIO will typically provide even better performance than using\nJava NIO.\nThe AIO journal is only available when running Linux kernel 2.6 or\nlater and after having installed libaio (if it's not already\ninstalled). For instructions on how to install libaio please see Installing AIO section.\nAlso, please note that AIO will only work with the following file\nsystems: ext2, ext3, ext4, jfs, xfs. With other file systems, e.g.\nNFS it may appear to work, but it will fall back to a slower\nsynchronous behaviour. Don't put the journal on a NFS share!\nFor more information on libaio please see lib AIO.\nlibaio is part of the kernel project.\n\nMemory mapped.\nThe third implementation uses a file-backed READ_WRITE\nmemory mapping against the OS page cache to interface with the file system.\nThis provides extremely good performance (especially under strictly process failure durability requirements), \nalmost zero copy (actually is the kernel page cache) and zero garbage (from the Java HEAP perspective) operations and runs \non any platform where there's a Java 4+ runtime.\nUnder power failure durability requirements it will perform at least on par with the NIO journal with the only \nexception of Linux OS with kernel less or equals 2.6, in which the msync) implementation necessary to ensure \ndurable writes was different (and slower) from the fsync) used is case of NIO journal.\nIt benefits by the configuration of OS huge pages#Huge_pages),\nin particular when is used a big number of journal files and sizing them as multiple of the OS page size in bytes.    \n\n\nThe standard Apache ActiveMQ Artemis core server uses two instances of the journal:\n\nBindings journal.\nThis journal is used to store bindings related data. That includes\nthe set of queues that are deployed on the server and their\nattributes. It also stores data such as id sequence counters.\nThe bindings journal is always a NIO journal as it is typically low\nthroughput compared to the message journal.\nThe files on this journal are prefixed as activemq-bindings. Each\nfile has a bindings extension. File size is 1048576, and it is\nlocated at the bindings folder.\n\nMessage journal.\nThis journal instance stores all message related data, including the\nmessage themselves and also duplicate-id caches.\nBy default Apache ActiveMQ Artemis will try and use an AIO journal. If AIO is not\navailable, e.g. the platform is not Linux with the correct kernel\nversion or AIO has not been installed then it will automatically\nfall back to using Java NIO which is available on any Java platform.\nThe files on this journal are prefixed as activemq-data. Each file\nhas a amq extension. File size is by the default 10485760\n(configurable), and it is located at the journal folder.\n\n\nFor large messages, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis persists them outside the message journal.\nThis is discussed in Large Messages.\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis can also be configured to page messages to disk in low memory\nsituations. This is discussed in Paging.\nIf no persistence is required at all, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis can also be configured\nnot to persist any data at all to storage as discussed in the Configuring\nthe broker for Zero Persistence section.\nConfiguring the bindings journal\nThe bindings journal is configured using the following attributes in\nbroker.xml\n\nbindings-directory\nThis is the directory in which the bindings journal lives. The\ndefault value is data/bindings.\n\ncreate-bindings-dir\nIf this is set to true then the bindings directory will be\nautomatically created at the location specified in\nbindings-directory if it does not already exist. The default value\nis true\n\n\nConfiguring the jms journal\nThe jms config shares its configuration with the bindings journal.\nConfiguring the message journal\nThe message journal is configured using the following attributes in\nbroker.xml\n\njournal-directory\nThis is the directory in which the message journal lives. The\ndefault value is data/journal.\nFor the best performance, we recommend the journal is located on its\nown physical volume in order to minimise disk head movement. If the\njournal is on a volume which is shared with other processes which\nmight be writing other files (e.g. bindings journal, database, or\ntransaction coordinator) then the disk head may well be moving\nrapidly between these files as it writes them, thus drastically\nreducing performance.\nWhen the message journal is stored on a SAN we recommend each\njournal instance that is stored on the SAN is given its own LUN\n(logical unit).\n\ncreate-journal-dir\nIf this is set to true then the journal directory will be\nautomatically created at the location specified in\njournal-directory if it does not already exist. The default value\nis true\n\njournal-type\nValid values are NIO, ASYNCIO or MAPPED.\nChoosing NIO chooses the Java NIO journal. Choosing ASYNCIO chooses\nthe Linux asynchronous IO journal. If you choose ASYNCIO but are not\nrunning Linux or you do not have libaio installed then Apache ActiveMQ Artemis will\ndetect this and automatically fall back to using NIO.\nChoosing MAPPED chooses the Java Memory Mapped journal.\n\njournal-sync-transactional\nIf this is set to true then Apache ActiveMQ Artemis will make sure all transaction\ndata is flushed to disk on transaction boundaries (commit, prepare\nand rollback). The default value is true.\n\njournal-sync-non-transactional\nIf this is set to true then Apache ActiveMQ Artemis will make sure non\ntransactional message data (sends and acknowledgements) are flushed\nto disk each time. The default value for this is true.\n\njournal-file-size\nThe size of each journal file in bytes. The default value for this\nis 10485760 bytes (10MiB).\n\njournal-min-files\nThe minimum number of files the journal will maintain. When Apache ActiveMQ Artemis\nstarts and there is no initial message data, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis will\npre-create journal-min-files number of files.\nCreating journal files and filling them with padding is a fairly\nexpensive operation and we want to minimise doing this at run-time\nas files get filled. By pre-creating files, as one is filled the\njournal can immediately resume with the next one without pausing to\ncreate it.\nDepending on how much data you expect your queues to contain at\nsteady state you should tune this number of files to match that\ntotal amount of data.\n\njournal-pool-files\nThe system will create as many files as needed however when reclaiming files\nit will shrink back to the journal-pool-files.\nThe default to this parameter is -1, meaning it will never delete files on the journal once created.\nNotice that the system can't grow infinitely as you are still required to use paging for destinations that can\ngrow indefinitely.\nNotice: in case you get too many files you can use compacting.\n\njournal-max-io\nWrite requests are queued up before being submitted to the system\nfor execution. This parameter controls the maximum number of write\nrequests that can be in the IO queue at any one time. If the queue\nbecomes full then writes will block until space is freed up.\nWhen using NIO, this value should always be equal to 1\nWhen using AIO, the default should be 500.\nThe system maintains different defaults for this parameter depending\non whether it's NIO or AIO (default for NIO is 1, default for AIO is\n500)\nThere is a limit and the total max AIO can't be higher than what is\nconfigured at the OS level (/proc/sys/fs/aio-max-nr) usually at\n65536.\n\njournal-buffer-timeout\nInstead of flushing on every write that requires a flush, we\nmaintain an internal buffer, and flush the entire buffer either when\nit is full, or when a timeout expires, whichever is sooner. This is\nused for both NIO and AIO and allows the system to scale better with\nmany concurrent writes that require flushing.\nThis parameter controls the timeout at which the buffer will be\nflushed if it hasn't filled already. AIO can typically cope with a\nhigher flush rate than NIO, so the system maintains different\ndefaults for both NIO and AIO (default for NIO is 3333333\nnanoseconds - 300 times per second, default for AIO is 500000\nnanoseconds - ie. 2000 times per second).\n\nNote\nBy increasing the timeout, you may be able to increase system\nthroughput at the expense of latency, the default parameters are\nchosen to give a reasonable balance between throughput and\nlatency.\n\n\njournal-buffer-size\nThe size of the timed buffer on AIO. The default value is 490KiB.\n\njournal-compact-min-files\nThe minimal number of files before we can consider compacting the\njournal. The compacting algorithm won't start until you have at\nleast journal-compact-min-files\nSetting this to 0 will disable the feature to compact completely.\nThis could be dangerous though as the journal could grow indefinitely.\nUse it wisely!\n\n\nThe default for this parameter is `10`\n\njournal-compact-percentage\nThe threshold to start compacting. When less than this percentage is\nconsidered live data, we start compacting. Note also that compacting\nwon't kick in until you have at least journal-compact-min-files\ndata files on the journal\nThe default for this parameter is 30\n\njournal-datasync (default: true)\nThis will disable the use of fdatasync on journal writes.\nWhen enabled it ensures full power failure durability, otherwise \nprocess failure durability on journal writes (OS guaranteed).\nThis is particular effective for NIO and MAPPED journals, which rely on \n fsync/msync to force write changes to disk.\n\n\nAn important note on disabling journal-datasync.\n\nAny modern OS guarantees that on process failures (i.e. crash) all the uncommitted changes\nto the page cache will be flushed to the file system, maintaining coherence between \nsubsequent operations against the same pages and ensuring that no data will be lost.\nThe predictability of the timing of such flushes, in case of a disabled journal-datasync,\ndepends on the OS configuration, but without compromising (or relaxing) the process \nfailure durability semantics as described above.\nRely on the OS page cache sacrifice the power failure protection, while increasing the \neffectiveness of the journal operations, capable of exploiting \nthe read caching and write combining features provided by the OS's kernel page cache subsystem.\n\nAn important note on disabling disk write cache.\n\nWarning\nMost disks contain hardware write caches. A write cache can increase\nthe apparent performance of the disk because writes just go into the\ncache and are then lazily written to the disk later.\nThis happens irrespective of whether you have executed a fsync() from\nthe operating system or correctly synced data from inside a Java\nprogram!\nBy default many systems ship with disk write cache enabled. This means\nthat even after syncing from the operating system there is no\nguarantee the data has actually made it to disk, so if a failure\noccurs, critical data can be lost.\nSome more expensive disks have non volatile or battery backed write\ncaches which won't necessarily lose data on event of failure, but you\nneed to test them!\nIf your disk does not have an expensive non volatile or battery backed\ncache and it's not part of some kind of redundant array (e.g. RAID),\nand you value your data integrity you need to make sure disk write\ncache is disabled.\nBe aware that disabling disk write cache can give you a nasty shock\nperformance wise. If you've been used to using disks with write cache\nenabled in their default setting, unaware that your data integrity\ncould be compromised, then disabling it will give you an idea of how\nfast your disk can perform when acting really reliably.\nOn Linux you can inspect and/or change your disk's write cache\nsettings using the tools hdparm (for IDE disks) or sdparm or\nsginfo (for SDSI/SATA disks)\nOn Windows you can check / change the setting by right clicking on the\ndisk and clicking properties.\n\nInstalling AIO\nThe Java NIO journal gives great performance, but If you are running\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis using Linux Kernel 2.6 or later, we highly recommend you use\nthe AIO journal for the very best persistence performance.\nIt's not possible to use the AIO journal under other operating systems\nor earlier versions of the Linux kernel.\nIf you are running Linux kernel 2.6 or later and don't already have\nlibaio installed, you can easily install it using the following steps:\nUsing yum, (e.g. on Fedora or Red Hat Enterprise Linux):\nyum install libaio\nUsing aptitude, (e.g. on Ubuntu or Debian system):\napt-get install libaio\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis JDBC Persistence\nWARNING: The Apache ActiveMQ Artemis JDBC persistence store is under development and is included for evaluation purposes.\nThe Apache ActiveMQ Artemis JDBC persistence layer offers the ability to store broker state (Messages, Addresses and other\napplication state) using a database.  N.B. Address full policy Paging (See: The section on Paging) is currently not\nsupported with the JDBC persistence layer.\nUsing the ActiveMQ Artemis File Journal is the recommended configuration as it offers higher levels of performance and is\nmore mature.  The JDBC persistence layer is targeted to those users who must use a database e.g. due to internal company\npolicy.\nActiveMQ Artemis currently has support for a limited number of database vendors (older versions may work but mileage may\nvary):\n\nPostgreSQL 9.4.x\nMySQL 5.7.x\nApache Derby 10.11.1.1\n\nThe JDBC store uses a JDBC connection to store messages and bindings data in records in database tables.  The data stored\nin the database tables is encoded using Apache ActiveMQ Artemis internal encodings.\nConfiguring JDBC Persistence\nTo configure Apache ActiveMQ Artemis to use a database for persisting messages and bindings data you must do two things.\n\nAdd the appropriate JDBC driver libraries to the Artemis runtime.  You can do this by dropping the relevant jars in the lib folder of the ActiveMQ Artemis distribution.\n\nCreate a store element in your broker.xml config file under the  element.  For example:\n\n\n      \n         \n            jdbc:derby:data/derby/database-store;create=true\n            BINDINGS_TABLE\n            MESSAGE_TABLE\n            MESSAGE_TABLE\n            LARGE_MESSAGES_TABLE\n            org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedDriver\n         \n      \n\n\njdbc-connection-url\nThe full JDBC connection URL for your database server.  The connection url should include all configuration parameters and database name.  Note: When configuring the server using the XML configuration files please ensure to escape any illegal chars; \"&\" for example, is typical in JDBC connection url and should be escaped to \"&\".\n\nbindings-table-name\nThe name of the table in which bindings data will be persisted for the ActiveMQ Artemis server.  Specifying table names allows users to share single database amongst multiple servers, without interference.\n\nmessage-table-name\nThe name of the table in which bindings data will be persisted for the ActiveMQ Artemis server.  Specifying table names allows users to share single database amongst multiple servers, without interference.\n\nlarge-message-table-name\nThe name of the table in which messages and related data will be persisted for the ActiveMQ Artemis server.  Specifying table names allows users to share single database amongst multiple servers, without interference.\n\npage-store-table-name\nThe name of the table to house the page store directory information.  Note that each address will have it's own page table which will use this name appended with a unique id of up to 20 characters.\n\njdbc-driver-class-name\nThe fully qualified class name of the desired database Driver.\n\njdbc-network-timeout\nThe JDBC network connection timeout in milliseconds. The default value\nis 20000 milliseconds (ie 20 seconds).\n\njdbc-lock-acquisition-timeout\nThe max allowed time in milliseconds while trying to acquire a JDBC lock. The default value\nis 60000 milliseconds (ie 60 seconds).\n\njdbc-lock-renew-period\nThe period in milliseconds of the keep alive service of a JDBC lock. The default value\nis 2000 milliseconds (ie 2 seconds).\n\njdbc-lock-expiration\nThe time in milliseconds a JDBC lock is considered valid without keeping it alive. The default value\nis 20000 milliseconds (ie 20 seconds).\n\n\nNote that some DBMS (e.g. Oracle, 30 chars) have restrictions on the size of table names, this should be taken into consideration when configuring table names for the Artemis database store, pay particular attention to the page store table name, which can be appended with a unique ID of up to 20 characters.  (for Oracle this would mean configuring a page-store-table-name of max size of 10 chars).\nConfiguring Apache ActiveMQ Artemis for Zero Persistence\nIn some situations, zero persistence is sometimes required for a\nmessaging system. Configuring Apache ActiveMQ Artemis to perform zero persistence is\nstraightforward. Simply set the parameter persistence-enabled in\nbroker.xml to false.\nPlease note that if you set this parameter to false, then zero\npersistence will occur. That means no bindings data, message data, large\nmessage data, duplicate id caches or paging data will be persisted.\n"},"configuring-transports.html":{"url":"configuring-transports.html","title":"Configuring Transports","keywords":"","body":"Configuring the Transport\nIn this chapter we'll describe the concepts required for understanding\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis transports and where and how they're configured.\nUnderstanding Acceptors\nOne of the most important concepts in Apache ActiveMQ Artemis transports is the\nacceptor.

There's no\nupper limit to the number of acceptors per server.\nEach acceptor defines a way in which connections can be made to the\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis server.\nIn the above example we're defining an acceptor that uses\nNetty to listen for connections at port\n61617.\nThe acceptor element contains a URL that defines the kind of Acceptor\nto create along with its configuration. The schema part of the URL\ndefines the Acceptor type which can either be tcp or vm which is\nNetty or an In VM Acceptor respectively. For Netty the host and the\nport of the URL define what host and port the acceptor will bind to. For\nIn VM the Authority part of the URL defines a unique server id.\nThe acceptor can also be configured with a set of key=value pairs\nused to configure the specific transport, the set of\nvalid key=value pairs depends on the specific transport be used and are\npassed straight through to the underlying transport. These are set on the\nURL as part of the query, like so:\ntcp://localhost:61617?sslEnabled=true&keyStorePath=/path\nUnderstanding Connectors\nWhereas acceptors are used on the server to define how we accept\nconnections, connectors are used to define how to connect to a server.\nLet's look at a connector defined in our broker.xml file:\n\n   tcp://localhost:61617\n\nConnectors can be defined inside a connectors element. There can be\none or more connectors defined in the connectors element. There's no\nupper limit to the number of connectors per server.\nA connector is used when the server acts as a client itself, e.g.:\n\nWhen one server is bridged to another\nWhen a server takes part in a cluster\n\nIn these cases the server needs to know how to connect to other servers.\nThat's defined by connectors.\nConfiguring the transport directly from the client side.\nHow do we configure a core ClientSessionFactory with the information\nthat it needs to connect with a server?\nConnectors are also used indirectly when configuring a core\nClientSessionFactory to directly talk to a server. Although in this\ncase there's no need to define such a connector in the server side\nconfiguration, instead we just specify the appropriate URI.\nHere's an example of creating a ClientSessionFactory which will\nconnect directly to the acceptor we defined earlier in this chapter, it\nuses the standard Netty TCP transport and will try and connect on port\n61617 to localhost (default):\nServerLocator locator = ActiveMQClient.createServerLocator(\"tcp://localhost:61617\");\n\nClientSessionFactory sessionFactory = locator.createClientSessionFactory();\n\nClientSession session = sessionFactory.createSession(...);\n\nSimilarly, if you're using JMS, you can configure the JMS connection\nfactory directly on the client side:\nConnectionFactory connectionFactory = new ActiveMQConnectionFactory(\"tcp://localhost:61617\");\n\nConnection jmsConnection = connectionFactory.createConnection();\n\nConfiguring the Netty transport\nOut of the box, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis currently uses\nNetty, a high performance low level\nnetwork library.\nOur Netty transport can be configured in several different ways; to use\nstraightforward TCP sockets, SSL, or to tunnel over HTTP or HTTPS..\nWe believe this caters for the vast majority of transport requirements.\nSingle Port Support\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis supports using a single port for all\nprotocols, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis will automatically detect which protocol is being\nused CORE, AMQP, STOMP or OPENWIRE and use the appropriate Apache ActiveMQ Artemis\nhandler. It will also detect whether protocols such as HTTP or Web\nSockets are being used and also use the appropriate decoders\nIt is possible to limit which protocols are supported by using the\nprotocols parameter on the Acceptor like so:\n    tcp://localhost:61617?protocols=CORE,AMQP\nConfiguring Netty TCP\nNetty TCP is a simple unencrypted TCP sockets based transport. If you're\nrunning connections across an untrusted network please bear in\nmind this transport is unencrypted. You may want to look at the SSL or\nHTTPS configurations.\nWith the Netty TCP transport all connections are initiated from the\nclient side (i.e. the server does not initiate any connections to the\nclient). This works well with firewall policies that typically only allow\nconnections to be initiated in one direction.\nAll the valid keys for the tcp URL scheme used for Netty are defined in the\nclass org.apache.activemq.artemis.core.remoting.impl.netty.TransportConstants.\nMost parameters can be used either with acceptors or connectors, some only\nwork with acceptors. The following parameters can be used to configure\nNetty for simple TCP:\n\nNote\nThe host and port parameters are only used in the core API, in\nXML configuration these are set in the URI host and port.\n\n\nhost. This specifies the host name or IP address to connect to\n(when configuring a connector) or to listen on (when configuring an\nacceptor). The default value for this property is localhost. When\nconfiguring acceptors, multiple hosts or IP addresses can be\nspecified by separating them with commas. It is also possible to\nspecify 0.0.0.0 to accept connection from all the host's network\ninterfaces. It's not valid to specify multiple addresses when\nspecifying the host for a connector; a connector makes a connection\nto one specific address.\n\nNote\nDon't forget to specify a host name or IP address! If you want\nyour server able to accept connections from other nodes you must\nspecify a hostname or IP address at which the acceptor will bind\nand listen for incoming connections. The default is localhost\nwhich of course is not accessible from remote nodes!\n\n\nport. This specified the port to connect to (when configuring a\nconnector) or to listen on (when configuring an acceptor). The\ndefault value for this property is 61616.\n\ntcpNoDelay. If this is true then Nagle's\nalgorithm will be\ndisabled. This is a Java (client) socket\noption.\nThe default value for this property is true.\n\ntcpSendBufferSize. This parameter determines the size of the\nTCP send buffer in bytes. The default value for this property is\n32768 bytes (32KiB).\nTCP buffer sizes should be tuned according to the bandwidth and\nlatency of your network. Here's a good link that explains the theory\nbehind this.\nIn summary TCP send/receive buffer sizes should be calculated as:\nbuffer_size = bandwidth * RTT.\nWhere bandwidth is in bytes per second and network round trip time\n(RTT) is in seconds. RTT can be easily measured using the ping\nutility.\nFor fast networks you may want to increase the buffer sizes from the\ndefaults.\n\ntcpReceiveBufferSize. This parameter determines the size of the\nTCP receive buffer in bytes. The default value for this property is\n32768 bytes (32KiB).\n\nwriteBufferLowWaterMark. This parameter determines the low water mark of \nthe Netty write buffer. Once the number of bytes queued in the write buffer exceeded \nthe high water mark and then dropped down below this value, Netty's channel \nwill start to be writable again. The default value for this property is \n32768 bytes (32KiB).\n\nwriteBufferHighWaterMark. This parameter determines the high water mark of \nthe Netty write buffer. If the number of bytes queued in the write buffer exceeds \nthis value, Netty's channel will start to be not writable. The default value for \nthis property is 131072 bytes (128KiB).\n\nbatchDelay. Before writing packets to the transport, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis can\nbe configured to batch up writes for a maximum of batchDelay\nmilliseconds. This can increase overall throughput for very small\nmessages. It does so at the expense of an increase in average\nlatency for message transfer. The default value for this property is\n0 ms.\n\ndirectDeliver. When a message arrives on the server and is\ndelivered to waiting consumers, by default, the delivery is done on\nthe same thread as that on which the message arrived. This gives\ngood latency in environments with relatively small messages and a\nsmall number of consumers, but at the cost of overall throughput and\nscalability - especially on multi-core machines. If you want the\nlowest latency and a possible reduction in throughput then you can\nuse the default value for directDeliver (i.e. true). If you are\nwilling to take some small extra hit on latency but want the highest\nthroughput set directDeliver to false.\n\nnioRemotingThreads This is deprecated. It is replaced by remotingThreads, \nif you are using this please update your configuration\n\nremotingThreads. Apache ActiveMQ Artemis will,\nby default, use a number of threads equal to three times the number\nof cores (or hyper-threads) as reported by\nRuntime.getRuntime().availableProcessors() for processing incoming\npackets. If you want to override this value, you can set the number\nof threads by specifying this parameter. The default value for this\nparameter is -1 which means use the value from\nRuntime.getRuntime().availableProcessors() * 3.\n\nlocalAddress. When configured a Netty Connector it is possible to\nspecify which local address the client will use when connecting to\nthe remote address. This is typically used in the Application Server\nor when running Embedded to control which address is used for\noutbound connections. If the local-address is not set then the\nconnector will use any local address available\n\nlocalPort. When configured a Netty Connector it is possible to\nspecify which local port the client will use when connecting to the\nremote address. This is typically used in the Application Server or\nwhen running Embedded to control which port is used for outbound\nconnections. If the local-port default is used, which is 0, then the\nconnector will let the system pick up an ephemeral port. valid ports\nare 0 to 65535\n\nconnectionsAllowed. This is only valid for acceptors. It limits the\nnumber of connections which the acceptor will allow. When this limit\nis reached a DEBUG level message is issued to the log, and the connection\nis refused. The type of client in use will determine what happens when\nthe connection is refused. In the case of a core client, it will\nresult in a org.apache.activemq.artemis.api.core.ActiveMQConnectionTimedOutException.\n\n\nConfiguring Netty Native Transport\nNetty Native Transport support exists for selected OS platforms.\nThis allows Apache ActiveMQ Artemis to use native sockets/io instead of Java NIO.\nThese Native transports add features specific to a particular platform, \ngenerate less garbage, and generally improve performance when compared to Java NIO based transport.\nBoth Clients and Server can benefit from this.\nCurrent Supported Platforms.\n\nLinux running 64bit JVM\nMacOS running 64bit JVM\n\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis will by default enable the corresponding native transport if a supported platform is detected.\nIf running on an unsupported platform or any issues loading native libs, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis will fallback onto Java NIO.\nLinux Native Transport\nOn supported Linux platforms Epoll is used, @see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoll. \nThe following properties are specific to this native transport:\n\nuseEpoll enables the use of epoll if a supported linux platform is running a 64bit JVM is detected. \n Setting this to false will force the use of Java NIO instead of epoll. Default is true\n\nMacOS Native Transport\nOn supported MacOS platforms KQueue is used, @see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kqueue. \nThe following properties are specific to this native transport:\n\nuseKQueue enables the use of kqueue if a supported MacOS platform running a 64bit JVM is detected. \n Setting this to false will force the use of Java NIO instead of kqueue. Default is true\n\nConfiguring Netty SSL\nNetty SSL is similar to the Netty TCP transport but it provides\nadditional security by encrypting TCP connections using the Secure\nSockets Layer SSL\nPlease see the examples for a full working example of using Netty SSL.\nNetty SSL uses all the same properties as Netty TCP but adds the\nfollowing additional properties:\n\nsslEnabled\nMust be true to enable SSL. Default is false.\n\nkeyStorePath\nWhen used on an acceptor this is the path to the SSL key store on\nthe server which holds the server's certificates (whether\nself-signed or signed by an authority).\nWhen used on a connector this is the path to the client-side SSL\nkey store which holds the client certificates. This is only relevant\nfor a connector if you are using 2-way SSL (i.e. mutual\nauthentication). Although this value is configured on the server, it\nis downloaded and used by the client. If the client needs to use a\ndifferent path from that set on the server then it can override the\nserver-side setting by either using the customary\n\"javax.net.ssl.keyStore\" system property or the ActiveMQ-specific\n\"org.apache.activemq.ssl.keyStore\" system property. The\nActiveMQ-specific system property is useful if another component on\nclient is already making use of the standard, Java system property.\n\nkeyStorePassword\nWhen used on an acceptor this is the password for the server-side\nkeystore.\nWhen used on a connector this is the password for the client-side\nkeystore. This is only relevant for a connector if you are using\n2-way SSL (i.e. mutual authentication). Although this value can be\nconfigured on the server, it is downloaded and used by the client.\nIf the client needs to use a different password from that set on the\nserver then it can override the server-side setting by either using\nthe customary \"javax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword\" system property or\nthe ActiveMQ-specific \"org.apache.activemq.ssl.keyStorePassword\"\nsystem property. The ActiveMQ-specific system property is useful if\nanother component on client is already making use of the standard,\nJava system property.\n\ntrustStorePath\nWhen used on an acceptor this is the path to the server-side SSL\nkey store that holds the keys of all the clients that the server\ntrusts. This is only relevant for an acceptor if you are using\n2-way SSL (i.e. mutual authentication).\nWhen used on a connector this is the path to the client-side SSL\nkey store which holds the public keys of all the servers that the\nclient trusts. Although this value can be configured on the server,\nit is downloaded and used by the client. If the client needs to use\na different path from that set on the server then it can override\nthe server-side setting by either using the customary\n\"javax.net.ssl.trustStore\" system property or the ActiveMQ-specific\n\"org.apache.activemq.ssl.trustStore\" system property. The\nActiveMQ-specific system property is useful if another component on\nclient is already making use of the standard, Java system property.\n\ntrustStorePassword\nWhen used on an acceptor this is the password for the server-side\ntrust store. This is only relevant for an acceptor if you are\nusing 2-way SSL (i.e. mutual authentication).\nWhen used on a connector this is the password for the client-side\ntruststore. Although this value can be configured on the server, it\nis downloaded and used by the client. If the client needs to use a\ndifferent password from that set on the server then it can override\nthe server-side setting by either using the customary\n\"javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword\" system property or the\nActiveMQ-specific \"org.apache.activemq.ssl.trustStorePassword\"\nsystem property. The ActiveMQ-specific system property is useful if\nanother component on client is already making use of the standard,\nJava system property.\n\nenabledCipherSuites\nWhether used on an acceptor or connector this is a comma\nseparated list of cipher suites used for SSL communication. The\ndefault value is null which means the JVM's default will be used.\n\nenabledProtocols\nWhether used on an acceptor or connector this is a comma\nseparated list of protocols used for SSL communication. The default\nvalue is null which means the JVM's default will be used.\n\nneedClientAuth\nThis property is only for an acceptor. It tells a client\nconnecting to this acceptor that 2-way SSL is required. Valid values\nare true or false. Default is false.\n\nverifyHost\nWhen used on an acceptor the CN of the connecting client's SSL certificate\nwill be compared to its hostname to verify they match. This is useful\nonly for 2-way SSL.\nWhen used on a connector the CN of the server's SSL certificate will be\ncompared to its hostname to verify they match. This is useful for both 1-way\nand 2-way SSL.\nValid values are true or false. Default is false.\n\ntrustAll\nWhen used on a connector the client will trust the provided server certificate\nimplicitly, regardless of any configured trust store.  Warning: This setting is\nprimarily for testing purposes only and should not be used in production.\nValid values are true or false. Default is false.    \n\nuseDefaultSslContext\nOnly valid on a connector. Allows the connector to use the \"default\" SSL\ncontext (via SSLContext.getDefault()) which can be set programmatically by\nthe client (via SSLContext.setDefault(SSLContext)). If set to true all\nother SSL related parameters except for sslEnabled are ignored.\nValid values are true or false. Default is false.\n\n\nConfiguring Netty HTTP\nNetty HTTP tunnels packets over the HTTP protocol. It can be useful in\nscenarios where firewalls only allow HTTP traffic to pass.\nPlease see the examples for a full working example of using Netty HTTP.\nNetty HTTP uses the same properties as Netty TCP but adds the following\nadditional properties:\n\nhttpEnabled. This is now no longer needed. With single port support\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis will now automatically detect if http is being\nused and configure itself.\n\nhttpClientIdleTime. How long a client can be idle before\nsending an empty http request to keep the connection alive\n\nhttpClientIdleScanPeriod. How often, in milliseconds, to scan\nfor idle clients\n\nhttpResponseTime. How long the server can wait before sending an\nempty http response to keep the connection alive\n\nhttpServerScanPeriod. How often, in milliseconds, to scan for\nclients needing responses\n\nhttpRequiresSessionId. If true the client will wait after the\nfirst call to receive a session id. Used the http connector is\nconnecting to servlet acceptor (not recommended)\n\n\n"},"config-reload.html":{"url":"config-reload.html","title":"Configuration Reload","keywords":"","body":"Configuration Reload\nThe system will perform a periodic check on the configuration files, configured by configuration-file-refresh-period, with the default at 5000, in milliseconds.\nOnce the configuration file is changed (broker.xml) the following modules will be reloaded automatically:\n\nAddress Settings\nSecurity Settings\nDiverts\nAddresses & queues\n\nNotice: \nDeletion of Address's and Queue's, not auto created is controlled by Address Settings\n\nconfig-delete-addresses\n\nOFF (DEFAULT) - will not remove upon config reload.\nFORCE - will remove the address and its queues upon config reload, even if messages remains, losing the messages in the address & queues.\n\n\nconfig-delete-queues\n\nOFF (DEFAULT) - will not remove upon config reload.\nFORCE - will remove the queue upon config reload, even if messages remains, losing the messages in the queue.\n\n\n\nBy default both settings are OFF as such address & queues won't be removed upon reload, given the risk of losing messages. \nWhen OFF You may execute explicit CLI or Management operations to remove address & queues.\nConfiguration Parameters that are reloaded at runtime\nThe broker configuration file has 2 main parts,  and .

If these were not removed they would cause a\nresource leak on the server and over time this result in the server\nrunning out of memory or other resources.\nWe have to balance the requirement for cleaning up dead client resources\nwith the fact that sometimes the network between the client and the\nserver can fail and then come back, allowing the client to reconnect.\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis supports client reconnection, so we don't want to clean up\n\"dead\" server side resources too soon or this will prevent any client\nfrom reconnecting, as it won't be able to find its old sessions on the\nserver.\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis makes all of this configurable via a connection TTL.\nBasically, the TTL determines how long the server will keep a connection\nalive in the absence of any data arriving from the client. The client will\nautomatically send \"ping\" packets periodically to prevent the server from\nclosing it down. If the server doesn't receive any packets on a connection\nfor the connection TTL time, then it will automatically close all the\nsessions on the server that relate to that connection.\nThe connection TTL is configured on the URI using the connectionTtl\nparameter.\nThe default value for connection ttl on an \"unreliable\" connection (e.g.\na Netty connection using the tcp URL scheme) is 60000ms, i.e. 1 minute.\nThe default value for connection ttl on a \"reliable\" connection (e.g. an\nin-vm connection using the vm URL scheme) is -1. A value of -1 for\nconnectionTTL means the server will never time out the connection on\nthe server side.\nIf you do not wish clients to be able to specify their own connection\nTTL, you can override all values used by a global value set on the\nserver side. This can be done by specifying the\nconnection-ttl-override attribute in the server side configuration.\nThe default value for connection-ttl-override is -1 which means \"do\nnot override\" (i.e. let clients use their own values).\nThe logic to check connections for TTL violations runs periodically on\nthe broker. By default, the checks are done every 2,000 milliseconds.\nHowever, this can be changed if necessary by using the \nconnection-ttl-check-interval attribute.\nClosing core sessions or JMS connections that you have failed to close\nAs previously discussed, it's important that all core client sessions\nand JMS connections are always closed explicitly in a finally block\nwhen you are finished using them.\nIf you fail to do so, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis will detect this at garbage collection\ntime, and log a warning (If you are using JMS the warning will involve a JMS connection).\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis will then close the connection / client session for you.\nNote that the log will also tell you the exact line of your user code\nwhere you created the JMS connection / client session that you later did\nnot close. This will enable you to pinpoint the error in your code and\ncorrect it appropriately.\nDetecting failure from the client side.\nIn the previous section we discussed how the client sends pings to the\nserver and how \"dead\" connection resources are cleaned up by the server.\nThere's also another reason for pinging, and that's for the client to\nbe able to detect that the server or network has failed.\nAs long as the client is receiving data from the server it will consider\nthe connection to be still alive.\nIf the client does not receive any packets for a configurable number\nof milliseconds then it will consider the connection failed and will\neither initiate failover, or call any FailureListener instances (or\nExceptionListener instances if you are using JMS) depending on how \nit has been configured.\nThis is controlled by setting the clientFailureCheckPeriod parameter\non the URI your client is using to connect, e.g.\ntcp://localhost:61616?clientFailureCheckPeriod=30000.\nThe default value for client failure check period on an \"unreliable\"\nconnection (e.g. a Netty connection) is 30000 ms, i.e. 30 seconds. The\ndefault value for client failure check period on a \"reliable\" connection\n(e.g. an in-vm connection) is -1. A value of -1 means the client\nwill never fail the connection on the client side if no data is received\nfrom the server. Typically this is much lower than connection TTL to\nallow clients to reconnect in case of transitory failure.\nConfiguring Asynchronous Connection Execution\nMost packets received on the server side are executed on the remoting\nthread. These packets represent short-running operations and are always\nexecuted on the remoting thread for performance reasons.\nHowever, by default some kinds of packets are executed using a thread\nfrom a thread pool so that the remoting thread is not tied up for too\nlong. Please note that processing operations asynchronously on another\nthread adds a little more latency. These packets are:\n\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.core.protocol.core.impl.wireformat.RollbackMessage\n\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.core.protocol.core.impl.wireformat.SessionCloseMessage\n\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.core.protocol.core.impl.wireformat.SessionCommitMessage\n\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.core.protocol.core.impl.wireformat.SessionXACommitMessage\n\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.core.protocol.core.impl.wireformat.SessionXAPrepareMessage\n\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.core.protocol.core.impl.wireformat.SessionXARollbackMessage\n\n\nTo disable asynchronous connection execution, set the parameter\nasync-connection-execution-enabled in broker.xml to\nfalse (default value is true).\n"},"slow-consumers.html":{"url":"slow-consumers.html","title":"Detecting Slow Consumers","keywords":"","body":"Detecting Slow Consumers\nIn this section we will discuss how Apache ActiveMQ Artemis can be configured to deal\nwith slow consumers. A slow consumer with a server-side queue (e.g. JMS\ntopic subscriber) can pose a significant problem for broker performance.\nIf messages build up in the consumer's server-side queue then memory\nwill begin filling up and the broker may enter paging mode which would\nimpact performance negatively. However, criteria can be set so that\nconsumers which don't acknowledge messages quickly enough can\npotentially be disconnected from the broker which in the case of a\nnon-durable JMS subscriber would allow the broker to remove the\nsubscription and all of its messages freeing up valuable server\nresources.\nConfiguration required for detecting slow consumers\nBy default the server will not detect slow consumers. If slow consumer\ndetection is desired then see queue attributes chapter\nfor more details.\nThe calculation to determine whether or not a consumer is slow only\ninspects the number of messages a particular consumer has\nacknowledged. It doesn't take into account whether or not flow control\nhas been enabled on the consumer, whether or not the consumer is\nstreaming a large message, etc. Keep this in mind when configuring slow\nconsumer detection.\nPlease note that slow consumer checks are performed using the scheduled\nthread pool and that each queue on the broker with slow consumer\ndetection enabled will cause a new entry in the internal\njava.util.concurrent.ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor instance. If there\nare a high number of queues and the slow-consumer-check-period is\nrelatively low then there may be delays in executing some of the checks.\nHowever, this will not impact the accuracy of the calculations used by\nthe detection algorithm. See thread pooling for more details about this pool.\n"},"network-isolation.html":{"url":"network-isolation.html","title":"Avoiding Network Isolation","keywords":"","body":"Network Isolation (Split Brain)\nIt is possible that if a replicated live or backup server becomes isolated in a network that failover will occur and you will end up\nwith 2 live servers serving messages in a cluster, this we call split brain. There are different configurations you can choose\nfrom that will help mitigate this problem\nQuorum Voting\nQuorum voting is used by both the live and the backup to decide what to do if a replication connection is disconnected. \nBasically the server will request each live server in the cluster to vote as to whether it thinks the server it is replicating \nto or from is still alive. This being the case the minimum number of live/backup pairs needed is 3. If less than 3 pairs \nare used then the only option is to use a Network Pinger which is explained later in this chapter or choose how you want each server to \nreact which the following details:\nBackup Voting\nBy default if a replica loses its replication connection to the live broker it makes a decision as to whether to start or not\nwith a quorum vote. This of course requires that there be at least 3 pairs of live/backup nodes in the cluster. For a 3 node \ncluster it will start if it gets 2 votes back saying that its live server is no longer available, for 4 nodes this would be \n3 votes and so on.\nIt's also possible to statically set the quorum size that should be used fotr the case where the cluster size is known up front,\nthis is done on the Replica Policy like so:\n\n  \n    \n       2\n    \n  \n\n\nIn this example the quorum size is set to 2 so if you were using a single pair and the backup lost connectivity it would \nnever start.\nLive Voting\nBy default, if the live server loses its replication connection then it will just carry on and wait for a backup to reconnect \nand start replicating again. In the event of a possible split brain scenario this may mean that the live stays live even though\nthe backup has been activated. It is possible to configure the live server to vote for a quorum if this happens, in this way\nif the live server doesn't not receive a majority vote then it will shutdown. This is done by setting the vote-on-replication-failure \nto true.\n\n  \n    \n       true\n       2\n    \n  \n\n\nAs in the backup policy it is also possible to statically configure the quorum size.\nPinging the network\nYou may configure one more addresses on the broker.xml that are part of your network topology, that will be pinged through the life cycle of the server.\nThe server will stop itself until the network is back on such case.\nIf you execute the create command passing a -ping argument, you will create a default xml that is ready to be used with network checks:\n./artemis create /myDir/myServer --ping 10.0.0.1\nThis XML part will be added to your broker.xml:\n element.\n theNicName\n-->\n\nhttp://www.apache.org -->\n\n10000\n1000\n\n\n10.0.0.1\n\n\nping -c 1 -t %d %s\n\n\nping6 -c 1 %2$s\n\nOnce you lose connectivity towards 10.0.0.1 on the given example\n, you will see see this output at the server:\n09:49:24,562 WARN  [org.apache.activemq.artemis.core.server.NetworkHealthCheck] Ping Address /10.0.0.1 wasn't reacheable\n09:49:36,577 INFO  [org.apache.activemq.artemis.core.server.NetworkHealthCheck] Network is unhealthy, stopping service ActiveMQServerImpl::serverUUID=04fd5dd8-b18c-11e6-9efe-6a0001921ad0\n09:49:36,625 INFO  [org.apache.activemq.artemis.core.server] AMQ221002: Apache ActiveMQ Artemis Message Broker version 1.6.0 [04fd5dd8-b18c-11e6-9efe-6a0001921ad0] stopped, uptime 14.787 seconds\n09:50:00,653 WARN  [org.apache.activemq.artemis.core.server.NetworkHealthCheck] ping: sendto: No route to host\n09:50:10,656 WARN  [org.apache.activemq.artemis.core.server.NetworkHealthCheck] Host is down: java.net.ConnectException: Host is down\n    at java.net.Inet6AddressImpl.isReachable0(Native Method) [rt.jar:1.8.0_73]\n    at java.net.Inet6AddressImpl.isReachable(Inet6AddressImpl.java:77) [rt.jar:1.8.0_73]\n    at java.net.InetAddress.isReachable(InetAddress.java:502) [rt.jar:1.8.0_73]\n    at org.apache.activemq.artemis.core.server.NetworkHealthCheck.check(NetworkHealthCheck.java:295) [artemis-commons-1.6.0-SNAPSHOT.jar:1.6.0-SNAPSHOT]\n    at org.apache.activemq.artemis.core.server.NetworkHealthCheck.check(NetworkHealthCheck.java:276) [artemis-commons-1.6.0-SNAPSHOT.jar:1.6.0-SNAPSHOT]\n    at org.apache.activemq.artemis.core.server.NetworkHealthCheck.run(NetworkHealthCheck.java:244) [artemis-commons-1.6.0-SNAPSHOT.jar:1.6.0-SNAPSHOT]\n    at org.apache.activemq.artemis.core.server.ActiveMQScheduledComponent$2.run(ActiveMQScheduledComponent.java:189) [artemis-commons-1.6.0-SNAPSHOT.jar:1.6.0-SNAPSHOT]\n    at org.apache.activemq.artemis.core.server.ActiveMQScheduledComponent$3.run(ActiveMQScheduledComponent.java:199) [artemis-commons-1.6.0-SNAPSHOT.jar:1.6.0-SNAPSHOT]\n    at java.util.concurrent.Executors$RunnableAdapter.call(Executors.java:511) [rt.jar:1.8.0_73]\n    at java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.runAndReset(FutureTask.java:308) [rt.jar:1.8.0_73]\n    at java.util.concurrent.ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor$ScheduledFutureTask.access$301(ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor.java:180) [rt.jar:1.8.0_73]\n    at java.util.concurrent.ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor$ScheduledFutureTask.run(ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor.java:294) [rt.jar:1.8.0_73]\n    at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1142) [rt.jar:1.8.0_73]\n    at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:617) [rt.jar:1.8.0_73]\n    at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:745) [rt.jar:1.8.0_73]\nOnce you re establish your network connections towards the configured check list:\n09:53:23,461 INFO  [org.apache.activemq.artemis.core.server.NetworkHealthCheck] Network is healthy, starting service ActiveMQServerImpl::\n09:53:23,462 INFO  [org.apache.activemq.artemis.core.server] AMQ221000: live Message Broker is starting with configuration Broker Configuration (clustered=false,journalDirectory=./data/journal,bindingsDirectory=./data/bindings,largeMessagesDirectory=./data/large-messages,pagingDirectory=./data/paging)\n09:53:23,462 INFO  [org.apache.activemq.artemis.core.server] AMQ221013: Using NIO Journal\n09:53:23,462 INFO  [org.apache.activemq.artemis.core.server] AMQ221043: Protocol module found: [artemis-server].

For performance reasons clients normally\nbuffer messages before delivering to the consumer via the receive()\nmethod or asynchronously via a message listener. If the consumer cannot\nprocess messages as fast as they are being delivered and stored in the\ninternal buffer, then you could end up with a situation where messages\nwould keep building up possibly causing out of memory on the client if\nthey cannot be processed in time.\nWindow-Based Flow Control\nBy default, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis consumers buffer messages from the server in a\nclient side buffer before the client consumes them. This improves\nperformance: otherwise every time the client consumes a message,\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis would have to go the server to request the next message. In\nturn, this message would then get sent to the client side, if one was\navailable.\nA network round trip would be involved for every message and\nconsiderably reduce performance.\nTo prevent this, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis pre-fetches messages into a buffer on each\nconsumer. The total maximum size of messages (in bytes) that will be\nbuffered on each consumer is determined by the consumerWindowSize\nparameter.\nBy default, the consumerWindowSize is set to 1 MiB (1024 * 1024\nbytes).\nThe value can be:\n\n-1 for an unbounded buffer\n\n0 to not buffer any messages.\n\n>0 for a buffer with the given maximum size in bytes.\n\n\nSetting the consumer window size can considerably improve performance\ndepending on the messaging use case. As an example, let's consider the\ntwo extremes:\nFast consumers\nFast consumers can process messages as fast as they consume them (or\neven faster)\nTo allow fast consumers, set the consumerWindowSize to -1. This\nwill allow unbounded message buffering on the client side.\nUse this setting with caution: it can overflow the client memory if\nthe consumer is not able to process messages as fast as it receives\nthem.\nSlow consumers\nSlow consumers takes significant time to process each message and it\nis desirable to prevent buffering messages on the client side so\nthat they can be delivered to another consumer instead.\nConsider a situation where a queue has 2 consumers; 1 of which is\nvery slow. Messages are delivered in a round robin fashion to both\nconsumers, the fast consumer processes all of its messages very\nquickly until its buffer is empty. At this point there are still\nmessages awaiting to be processed in the buffer of the slow consumer\nthus preventing them being processed by the fast consumer. The fast\nconsumer is therefore sitting idle when it could be processing the\nother messages.\nTo allow slow consumers, set consumerWindowSize on the URI to 0\n(for no buffer at all). This will prevent the slow consumer from\nbuffering any messages on the client side. Messages will remain on\nthe server side ready to be consumed by other consumers.\nSetting this to 0 can give deterministic distribution between\nmultiple consumers on a queue.\nMost of the consumers cannot be clearly identified as fast or slow\nconsumers but are in-between. In that case, setting the value of\nconsumerWindowSize to optimize performance depends on the messaging\nuse case and requires benchmarks to find the optimal value, but a value\nof 1MiB is fine in most cases.\nPlease see the examples chapter for an example which shows\nhow to configure ActiveMQ Artemis to prevent consumer buffering when dealing\nwith slow consumers.\nRate limited flow control\nIt is also possible to control the rate at which a consumer can\nconsume messages. This is a form of throttling and can be used to make\nsure that a consumer never consumes messages at a rate faster than the\nrate specified. This is configured using the consumerMaxRate URI\nparameter.\nThe rate must be a positive integer to enable this functionality and is\nthe maximum desired message consumption rate specified in units of\nmessages per second. Setting this to -1 disables rate limited flow\ncontrol. The default value is -1.\nPlease see the examples chapter for a working example of\nlimiting consumer rate.\n\nNote\nRate limited flow control can be used in conjunction with window based\nflow control. Rate limited flow control only effects how many messages\na client can consume in a second and not how many messages are in its\nbuffer. So if you had a slow rate limit and a high window based limit\nthe clients internal buffer would soon fill up with messages.\n\nProducer flow control\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis also can limit the amount of data sent from a client to a\nserver to prevent the server being overwhelmed.\nWindow based flow control\nIn a similar way to consumer window based flow control, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis\nproducers, by default, can only send messages to an address as long as\nthey have sufficient credits to do so. The amount of credits required to\nsend a message is given by the size of the message.\nAs producers run low on credits they request more from the server, when\nthe server sends them more credits they can send more messages.\nThe amount of credits a producer requests in one go is known as the\nwindow size and it is controlled by the producerWindowSize URI\nparameter.\nThe window size therefore determines the amount of bytes that can be\nin-flight at any one time before more need to be requested - this\nprevents the remoting connection from getting overloaded.\nBlocking producer window based flow control using CORE protocol\nWhen using the CORE protocol (used by both the Artemis Core Client and Artemis JMS Client)\nthe server will always aim give the same number of credits as have been requested.\nHowever, it is also possible to set a maximum size on any address, and the server\nwill never send more credits to any one producer than what is available according to\nthe address's upper memory limit.  Although a single producer will be issued more\ncredits than available (at the time of issue) it is possible that more than 1\nproducer be associated with the same address and so it is theoretically possible\nthat more credits are allocated across total producers than what is available.\nIt is therefore possible to go over the address limit by approximately:\n '''total number of producers on address * producer window size'''\nFor example, if I have a queue called \"myqueue\", I could set the\nmaximum memory size to 10MiB, and the the server will control the number\nof credits sent to any producers which are sending any messages to\nmyqueue such that the total messages in the queue never exceeds 10MiB.\nWhen the address gets full, producers will block on the client side\nuntil more space frees up on the address, i.e. until messages are\nconsumed from the queue thus freeing up space for more messages to be\nsent.\nWe call this blocking producer flow control, and it's an efficient way\nto prevent the server running out of memory due to producers sending\nmore messages than can be handled at any time.\nIt is an alternative approach to paging, which does not block producers\nbut instead pages messages to storage.\nTo configure an address with a maximum size and tell the server that you\nwant to block producers for this address if it becomes full, you need to\ndefine an AddressSettings (Configuring Queues Via Address Settings) block for the address and specify\nmax-size-bytes and address-full-policy\nThe address block applies to all queues registered to that address. I.e.\nthe total memory for all queues bound to that address will not exceed\nmax-size-bytes. In the case of JMS topics this means the total\nmemory of all subscriptions in the topic won't exceed max-size-bytes.\nHere's an example:\n\n   \n      100000\n      BLOCK\n   \n\nThe above example would set the max size of the queue \"exampleQueue\"\nto be 100000 bytes and would block any producers sending to that address\nto prevent that max size being exceeded.\nNote the policy must be set to BLOCK to enable blocking producer flow\ncontrol.\n\nNote\nNote that in the default configuration all addresses are set to block\nproducers after 10 MiB of message data is in the address. This means\nyou cannot send more than 10MiB of message data to an address without\nit being consumed before the producers will be blocked. If you do not\nwant this behaviour increase the max-size-bytes parameter or change\nthe address full message policy.\nNote\nProducer credits are allocated from the broker to the client.  Flow control\ncredit checking (i.e. checking a producer has enough credit) is done on the\nclient side only.  It is possible for the broker to over allocate credits, like\nin the multiple producer scenario outlined above.  It is also possible for\na misbehaving client to ignore the flow control credits issued by the broker\nand continue sending with out sufficient credit.\n\nBlocking producer window based flow control using AMQP\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis ships with out of the box with 2 protocols that support flow control. Artemis CORE protocol and\nAMQP. Both protocols implement flow control slightly differently and therefore address full BLOCK policy behaves slightly\ndifferent for clients that use each protocol respectively.\nAs explained earlier in this chapter the CORE protocol uses a producer window size flow control system. Where credits\n(representing bytes) are allocated to producers, if a producer wants to send a message it should wait until it has\nenough byte credits available for it to send. AMQP flow control credits are not representative of bytes but instead\nrepresent the number of messages a producer is permitted to send (regardless of the message size).\nBLOCK for AMQP works mostly in the same way as the producer window size mechanism above. Artemis will issue 100 credits\nto a client at a time and refresh them when the clients credits reaches 30. The broker will stop issuing credits once an\naddress is full. However, since AMQP credits represent whole messages and not bytes, it would be possible in some\nscenarios for an AMQP client to significantly exceed an address upper bound should the broker continue accepting\nmessages until the clients credits are exhausted. For this reason there is an additional parameter available on address\nsettings that specifies an upper bound on an address size in bytes. Once this upper bound is reach Artemis will start\nrejecting AMQP messages. This limit is the max-size-bytes-reject-threshold and is by default set to -1 (or no limit).\nThis is additional parameter allows a kind of soft and hard limit, in normal circumstances the broker will utilize the\nmax-size-bytes parameter using using flow control to put back pressure on the client, but will protect the broker by\nrejecting messages once the address size is reached.\nRate limited flow control\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis also allows the rate a producer can emit message to be limited,\nin units of messages per second. By specifying such a rate, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis\nwill ensure that producer never produces messages at a rate higher than\nthat specified. This is controlled by the producerMaxRate URL parameter.\nThe producerMaxRate must be a positive integer to enable this functionality and is\nthe maximum desired message production rate specified in units of\nmessages per second. Setting this to -1 disables rate limited flow\ncontrol. The default value is -1.\nPlease see the examples chapter for a working example of limiting \nproducer rate.\n"},"send-guarantees.html":{"url":"send-guarantees.html","title":"Guarantees of sends and commits","keywords":"","body":"Guarantees of sends and commits\nGuarantees of Transaction Completion\nWhen committing or rolling back a transaction with Apache ActiveMQ Artemis, the request\nto commit or rollback is sent to the server, and the call will block on\nthe client side until a response has been received from the server that\nthe commit or rollback was executed.\nWhen the commit or rollback is received on the server, it will be\ncommitted to the journal, and depending on the value of the parameter\njournal-sync-transactional the server will ensure that the commit or\nrollback is durably persisted to storage before sending the response\nback to the client. If this parameter has the value false then commit\nor rollback may not actually get persisted to storage until some time\nafter the response has been sent to the client. In event of server\nfailure this may mean the commit or rollback never gets persisted to\nstorage. The default value of this parameter is true so the client can\nbe sure all transaction commits or rollbacks have been persisted to\nstorage by the time the call to commit or rollback returns.\nSetting this parameter to false can improve performance at the expense\nof some loss of transaction durability.\nThis parameter is set in broker.xml\nGuarantees of Non Transactional Message Sends\nIf you are sending messages to a server using a non transacted session,\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis can be configured to block the call to send until the message\nhas definitely reached the server, and a response has been sent back to\nthe client. This can be configured individually for durable and\nnon-durable messages, and is determined by the following two URL parameters:\n\nblockOnDurableSend. If this is set to true then all calls to\nsend for durable messages on non transacted sessions will block\nuntil the message has reached the server, and a response has been\nsent back. The default value is true.\n\nblockOnNonDurableSend. If this is set to true then all calls to\nsend for non-durable messages on non transacted sessions will block\nuntil the message has reached the server, and a response has been\nsent back. The default value is false.\n\n\nSetting block on sends to true can reduce performance since each send\nrequires a network round trip before the next send can be performed.\nThis means the performance of sending messages will be limited by the\nnetwork round trip time (RTT) of your network, rather than the bandwidth\nof your network. For better performance we recommend either batching\nmany messages sends together in a transaction since with a transactional\nsession, only the commit / rollback blocks not every send, or, using\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis's advanced asynchronous send acknowledgements feature\ndescribed in Asynchronous Send Acknowledgements.\nWhen the server receives a message sent from a non transactional\nsession, and that message is durable and the message is routed to at\nleast one durable queue, then the server will persist the message in\npermanent storage. If the journal parameter\njournal-sync-non-transactional is set to true the server will not\nsend a response back to the client until the message has been persisted\nand the server has a guarantee that the data has been persisted to disk.\nThe default value for this parameter is true.\nGuarantees of Non Transactional Acknowledgements\nIf you are acknowledging the delivery of a message at the client side\nusing a non transacted session, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis can be configured to block the\ncall to acknowledge until the acknowledge has definitely reached the\nserver, and a response has been sent back to the client. This is\nconfigured with the parameter BlockOnAcknowledge. If this is set to\ntrue then all calls to acknowledge on non transacted sessions will\nblock until the acknowledge has reached the server, and a response has\nbeen sent back. You might want to set this to true if you want to\nimplement a strict at most once delivery policy. The default value is\nfalse\nAsynchronous Send Acknowledgements\nIf you are using a non transacted session but want a guarantee that\nevery message sent to the server has reached it, then, as discussed in\nGuarantees of Non Transactional Message Sends, you can configure Apache ActiveMQ Artemis to block the call to send until the server\nhas received the message, persisted it and sent back a response. This\nworks well but has a severe performance penalty - each call to send\nneeds to block for at least the time of a network round trip (RTT) - the\nperformance of sending is thus limited by the latency of the network,\nnot limited by the network bandwidth.\nLet's do a little bit of maths to see how severe that is. We'll consider\na standard 1Gib ethernet network with a network round trip between the\nserver and the client of 0.25 ms.\nWith a RTT of 0.25 ms, the client can send at most 1000/ 0.25 = 4000\nmessages per second if it blocks on each message send.\nIf each message is theoretical upper limit\nof (1024 * 1024 * 1024 / 8) / 1500 = 89478 messages per second if\nmessages are sent without blocking! These figures aren't an exact\nscience but you can clearly see that being limited by network RTT can\nhave serious effect on performance.\nTo remedy this, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis provides an advanced new feature called\nasynchronous send acknowledgements. With this feature, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis can be\nconfigured to send messages without blocking in one direction and\nasynchronously getting acknowledgement from the server that the messages\nwere received in a separate stream. By de-coupling the send from the\nacknowledgement of the send, the system is not limited by the network\nRTT, but is limited by the network bandwidth. Consequently better\nthroughput can be achieved than is possible using a blocking approach,\nwhile at the same time having absolute guarantees that messages have\nsuccessfully reached the server.\nThe window size for send acknowledgements is determined by the\nconfirmation-window-size parameter on the connection factory or client\nsession factory. Please see Client Reconnection and Session Reattachment for more info on this.\nAsynchronous Send Acknowledgements\nTo use the feature using the core API, you implement the interface\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.api.core.client.SendAcknowledgementHandler and set\na handler instance on your ClientSession.\nThen, you just send messages as normal using your ClientSession, and\nas messages reach the server, the server will send back an\nacknowledgement of the send asynchronously, and some time later you are\ninformed at the client side by Apache ActiveMQ Artemis calling your handler's\nsendAcknowledged(ClientMessage message) method, passing in a reference\nto the message that was sent.\nTo enable asynchronous send acknowledgements you must make sure\nconfirmationWindowSize is set to a positive integer value, e.g.\n10MiB\nPlease see the examples chapter for a full working example.\n"},"undelivered-messages.html":{"url":"undelivered-messages.html","title":"Message Redelivery and Undelivered Messages","keywords":"","body":"Message Redelivery and Undelivered Messages\nMessages can be delivered unsuccessfully (e.g. if the transacted session\nused to consume them is rolled back). Such a message goes back to its\nqueue ready to be redelivered. However, this means it is possible for a\nmessage to be delivered again and again without success thus remaining\nin the queue indefinitely, clogging the system.\nThere are 2 ways to deal with these undelivered messages:\n\nDelayed redelivery.\nIt is possible to delay messages redelivery.  This gives the client some\ntime to recover from any transient failures and to prevent overloading\nits network or CPU resources.\n\nDead Letter Address.\nIt is also possible to configure a dead letter address so that after\na specified number of unsuccessful deliveries, messages are removed\nfrom their queue and sent to the dead letter address.  These messages\nwill not be delivered again from this queue.\n\n\nBoth options can be combined for maximum flexibility.\nDelayed Redelivery\nDelaying redelivery can often be useful in cases where clients regularly\nfail or rollback. Without a delayed redelivery, the system can get into a\n\"thrashing\" state, with delivery being attempted, the client rolling back,\nand delivery being re-attempted ad infinitum in quick succession,\nconsuming valuable CPU and network resources.\nConfiguring Delayed Redelivery\nDelayed redelivery is defined in the address-setting configuration:\n\n\n\n1.5\n\n5000\n\n50000\n\n\nIf a redelivery-delay is specified, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis will wait this delay\nbefore redelivering the messages.\nBy default, there is no redelivery delay (redelivery-delayis set to\n0).\nOther subsequent messages will be delivery regularly, only the cancelled\nmessage will be sent asynchronously back to the queue after the delay.\nYou can specify a multiplier (the redelivery-delay-multiplier) that will\ntake effect on top of the redelivery-delay.  Each time a message is redelivered\nthe delay period will be equal to the previous delay  redelivery-delay-multiplier.\nA max-redelivery-delay can be set to prevent the delay from becoming too large.\nThe max-redelivery-delay is defaulted to redelivery-delay \\ 10.\nExample:\n- redelivery-delay=5000, redelivery-delay-multiplier=2, max-redelivery-delay=15000\n\n1. Delivery Attempt 1. (Unsuccessful)\n2. Wait Delay Period: 5000\n3. Delivery Attempt 2. (Unsuccessful)\n4. Wait Delay Period: 10000                   // (5000  * 2)  max-delay-period:  Use max-delay-delivery\nAddress wildcards can be used to configure redelivery delay for a set of\naddresses (see Understanding the Wildcard Syntax), so you don't have to specify redelivery delay\nindividually for each address.\nExample\nSee the examples chapter for an example which shows how delayed redelivery is configured\nand used with JMS.\nDead Letter Addresses\nTo prevent a client infinitely receiving the same undelivered message\n(regardless of what is causing the unsuccessful deliveries), messaging\nsystems define dead letter addresses: after a specified unsuccessful\ndelivery attempts, the message is removed from its queue and sent\nto a dead letter address.\nAny such messages can then be diverted to queue(s) where they can later\nbe perused by the system administrator for action to be taken.\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis's addresses can be assigned a dead letter address. Once the\nmessages have been unsuccessfully delivered for a given number of\nattempts, they are removed from their queue and sent to the relevant\ndead letter address. These dead letter messages can later be consumed\nfrom the dead letter address for further inspection.\nConfiguring Dead Letter Addresses\nDead letter address is defined in the address-setting configuration:\n\n\ndeadLetterQueue\n3\n\nIf a dead-letter-address is not specified, messages will removed after\nmax-delivery-attempts unsuccessful attempts.\nBy default, messages are redelivered 10 times at the maximum. Set\nmax-delivery-attempts to -1 for infinite redeliveries.\nA dead letter address can be set globally for a set of matching\naddresses and you can set max-delivery-attempts to -1 for a specific\naddress setting to allow infinite redeliveries only for this address.\nAddress wildcards can be used to configure dead letter settings for a\nset of addresses (see Understanding the Wildcard Syntax).\nDead Letter Properties\nDead letter messages which are consumed from a dead letter address have\nthe following properties:\n\n_AMQ_ORIG_ADDRESS\na String property containing the original address of the dead\nletter message\n\n_AMQ_ORIG_QUEUE\na String property containing the original queue of the dead letter\nmessage\n\n\nExample\nSee: Dead Letter section of the Examples for an example\nthat shows how dead letter is configured and used with JMS.\nDelivery Count Persistence\nIn normal use, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis does not update delivery count persistently\nuntil a message is rolled back (i.e. the delivery count is not updated\nbefore the message is delivered to the consumer). In most messaging\nuse cases, the messages are consumed, acknowledged and forgotten as soon\nas they are consumed. In these cases, updating the delivery count\npersistently before delivering the message would add an extra persistent\nstep for each message delivered, implying a significant performance\npenalty.\nHowever, if the delivery count is not updated persistently before the\nmessage delivery happens, in the event of a server crash, messages might\nhave been delivered but that will not have been reflected in the\ndelivery count. During the recovery phase, the server will not have\nknowledge of that and will deliver the message with redelivered set to\nfalse while it should be true.\nAs this behavior breaks strict JMS semantics, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis allows to persist\ndelivery count before message delivery but this feature is disabled by default\ndue to performance implications.\nTo enable it, set persist-delivery-count-before-delivery to true in\nbroker.xml:\ntrue\n"},"message-expiry.html":{"url":"message-expiry.html","title":"Message Expiry","keywords":"","body":"Message Expiry\nMessages can be set with an optional time to live when sending them.\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis will not deliver a message to a consumer after it's time to\nlive has been exceeded.

The server persists these fragments to disk as it receives\nthem and when the time comes to deliver them to a consumer they are read\nback of the disk, also in fragments and sent down the wire. When the\nconsumer receives a large message it initially receives just the message\nwith an empty body, it can then set an OutputStream on the message to\nstream the huge message body to a file on disk or elsewhere. At no time\nis the entire message body stored fully in memory, either on the client\nor the server.\nConfiguring the server\nLarge messages are stored on a disk directory on the server side, as\nconfigured on the main configuration file.\nThe configuration property large-messages-directory specifies where\nlarge messages are stored.  For JDBC persistence the large-message-table\nshould be configured.\n\n...\n/data/large-messages\n...\nBy default the large message directory is data/largemessages and large-message-table is\nconfigured as \"LARGE_MESSAGE_TABLE\".\nFor the best performance we recommend using file store with large messages directory stored\non a different physical volume to the message journal or paging directory.\nConfiguring Parameters\nAny message larger than a certain size is considered a large message.\nLarge messages will be split up and sent in fragments. This is\ndetermined by the URL parameter minLargeMessageSize\n\nNote\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis messages are encoded using 2 bytes per character so if the\nmessage data is filled with ASCII characters (which are 1 byte) the\nsize of the resulting Apache ActiveMQ Artemis message would roughly double. This is\nimportant when calculating the size of a \"large\" message as it may\nappear to be less than the minLargeMessageSize before it is sent,\nbut it then turns into a \"large\" message once it is encoded.\n\nThe default value is 100KiB.\nConfiguring the transport directly from the client side\nwill provide more information on how to instantiate the core session factory\nor JMS connection factory.\nCompressed Large Messages\nYou can choose to send large messages in compressed form using\ncompressLargeMessages URL parameter.\ncompressLargeMessages\nIf you specify the boolean URL parameter compressLargeMessages as true,\nThe system will use the ZIP algorithm to compress the message body as\nthe message is transferred to the server's side. Notice that there's no\nspecial treatment at the server's side, all the compressing and uncompressing\nis done at the client.\nIf the compressed size of a large message is below minLargeMessageSize,\nit is sent to server as regular messages. This means that the message won't\nbe written into the server's large-message data directory, thus reducing the\ndisk I/O.\nStreaming large messages\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis supports setting the body of messages using input and output\nstreams (java.lang.io)\nThese streams are then used directly for sending (input streams) and\nreceiving (output streams) messages.\nWhen receiving messages there are 2 ways to deal with the output stream;\nyou may choose to block while the output stream is recovered using the\nmethod ClientMessage.saveOutputStream or alternatively using the\nmethod ClientMessage.setOutputstream which will asynchronously write\nthe message to the stream. If you choose the latter the consumer must be\nkept alive until the message has been fully received.\nYou can use any kind of stream you like. The most common use case is to\nsend files stored in your disk, but you could also send things like JDBC\nBlobs, SocketInputStream, things you recovered from HTTPRequests\netc. Anything as long as it implements java.io.InputStream for sending\nmessages or java.io.OutputStream for receiving them.\nStreaming over Core API\nThe following table shows a list of methods available at ClientMessage\nwhich are also available through JMS by the use of object properties.\n\n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n    \n    \n    \n        Name\n        Description\n        JMS Equivalent\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        setBodyInputStream(InputStream)\n        Set the InputStream used to read a message body when sending it.\n        JMS_AMQ_InputStream\n    \n    \n        setOutputStream(OutputStream)\n        Set the OutputStream that will receive the body of a message.

It will block until the entire content is transferred to the `OutputStream`.\n        JMS_AMQ_SaveStream\n    \n    \n\n\nTo set the output stream when receiving a core message:\nClientMessage msg = consumer.receive(...);\n\n\n// This will block here until the stream was transferred\nmsg.saveOutputStream(someOutputStream);\n\nClientMessage msg2 = consumer.receive(...);\n\n// This will not wait the transfer to finish\nmsg2.setOutputStream(someOtherOutputStream);\n\nSet the input stream when sending a core message:\nClientMessage msg = session.createMessage();\nmsg.setInputStream(dataInputStream);\n\nNotice also that for messages with more than 2GiB the getBodySize() will\nreturn invalid values since this is an integer (which is also exposed to\nthe JMS API). On those cases you can use the message property\n_AMQ_LARGE_SIZE.\nStreaming over JMS\nWhen using JMS, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis maps the streaming methods on the core API (see\nClientMessage API table above) by setting object properties . You can use the method\nMessage.setObjectProperty to set the input and output streams.\nThe InputStream can be defined through the JMS Object Property\nJMS_AMQ_InputStream on messages being sent:\nBytesMessage message = session.createBytesMessage();\n\nFileInputStream fileInputStream = new FileInputStream(fileInput);\n\nBufferedInputStream bufferedInput = new BufferedInputStream(fileInputStream);\n\nmessage.setObjectProperty(\"JMS_AMQ_InputStream\", bufferedInput);\n\nsomeProducer.send(message);\n\nThe OutputStream can be set through the JMS Object Property\nJMS_AMQ_SaveStream on messages being received in a blocking way.\nBytesMessage messageReceived = (BytesMessage)messageConsumer.receive(120000);\n\nFile outputFile = new File(\"huge_message_received.dat\");\n\nFileOutputStream fileOutputStream = new FileOutputStream(outputFile);\n\nBufferedOutputStream bufferedOutput = new BufferedOutputStream(fileOutputStream);\n\n// This will block until the entire content is saved on disk\nmessageReceived.setObjectProperty(\"JMS_AMQ_SaveStream\", bufferedOutput);\n\nSetting the OutputStream could also be done in a non blocking way\nusing the property JMS_AMQ_OutputStream.\n// This won't wait the stream to finish. You need to keep the consumer active.\nmessageReceived.setObjectProperty(\"JMS_AMQ_OutputStream\", bufferedOutput);\n\n\nNote\nWhen using JMS, Streaming large messages are only supported on\nStreamMessage and BytesMessage.\n\nStreaming Alternative\nIf you choose not to use the InputStream or OutputStream capability\nof Apache ActiveMQ Artemis You could still access the data directly in an alternative\nfashion.\nOn the Core API just get the bytes of the body as you normally would.\nClientMessage msg = consumer.receive();\n\nbyte[] bytes = new byte[1024];\nfor (int i = 0 ;  i \nIf using JMS API, BytesMessage and StreamMessage also supports it\ntransparently.\nBytesMessage rm = (BytesMessage)cons.receive(10000);\n\nbyte data[] = new byte[1024];\n\nfor (int i = 0; i \nLarge message example\nPlease see the examples chapter for an example which shows\nhow large message is configured and used with JMS.\n"},"paging.html":{"url":"paging.html","title":"Paging","keywords":"","body":"Paging\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis transparently supports huge queues containing millions of\nmessages while the server is running with limited memory.\nIn such a situation it's not possible to store all of the queues in\nmemory at any one time, so Apache ActiveMQ Artemis transparently pages messages into\nand out of memory as they are needed, thus allowing massive queues with\na low memory footprint.\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis will start paging messages to disk, when the size of all\nmessages in memory for an address exceeds a configured maximum size.\nThe default configuration from Artemis has destinations with paging.\nPage Files\nMessages are stored per address on the file system.

If you set max-size-bytes = -1 on paging the global-max-size can still be used.\nWhen you have more messages than what is configured global-max-size any new produced message will make that destination to go through its paging policy. \nglobal-max-size is calculated as half of the max memory available to the Java Virtual Machine, unless specified on the broker.xml configuration.\nDropping messages\nInstead of paging messages when the max size is reached, an address can\nalso be configured to just drop messages when the address is full.\nTo do this just set the address-full-policy to DROP in the address\nsettings\nDropping messages and throwing an exception to producers\nInstead of paging messages when the max size is reached, an address can\nalso be configured to drop messages and also throw an exception on the\nclient-side when the address is full.\nTo do this just set the address-full-policy to FAIL in the address\nsettings\nBlocking producers\nInstead of paging messages when the max size is reached, an address can\nalso be configured to block producers from sending further messages when\nthe address is full, thus preventing the memory being exhausted on the\nserver.\nWhen memory is freed up on the server, producers will automatically\nunblock and be able to continue sending.\nTo do this just set the address-full-policy to BLOCK in the address\nsettings\nIn the default configuration, all addresses are configured to block\nproducers after 10 MiB of data are in the address.\nCaution with Addresses with Multiple Multicast Queues\nWhen a message is routed to an address that has multiple multicast queues bound to\nit, e.g. a JMS subscription in a Topic, there is only 1 copy of the\nmessage in memory. Each queue only deals with a reference to this.\nBecause of this the memory is only freed up once all queues referencing\nthe message have delivered it.\nIf you have a single lazy subscription, the entire address will suffer\nIO performance hit as all the queues will have messages being sent\nthrough an extra storage on the paging system.\nFor example:\n\nAn address has 10 multicast queues\n\nOne of the queues does not deliver its messages (maybe because of a\nslow consumer).\n\nMessages continually arrive at the address and paging is started.\n\nThe other 9 queues are empty even though messages have been sent.\n\n\nIn this example all the other 9 queues will be consuming messages from\nthe page system. This may cause performance issues if this is an\nundesirable state.\nMax Disk Usage\nThe System will perform scans on the disk to determine if the disk is beyond a configured limit. \nThese are configured through 'max-disk-usage' in percentage. Once that limit is reached any \nmessage will be blocked.

They pin all\nmessages with the same group id to the same consumer. If that\nconsumer closes another consumer is chosen and will receive all\nmessages with the same group id.\n\n\nMessage groups are useful when you want all messages for a certain value\nof the property to be processed serially by the same consumer.\nAn example might be orders for a certain stock. You may want orders for\nany particular stock to be processed serially by the same consumer. To\ndo this you can create a pool of consumers (perhaps one for each stock,\nbut less will work too), then set the stock name as the value of the\n_AMQ_GROUP_ID property.\nThis will ensure that all messages for a particular stock will always be\nprocessed by the same consumer.\n\nNote\nGrouped messages can impact the concurrent processing of non-grouped\nmessages due to the underlying FIFO semantics of a queue. For example,\nif there is a chunk of 100 grouped messages at the head of a queue\nfollowed by 1,000 non-grouped messages then all the grouped messages\nwill need to be sent to the appropriate client (which is consuming\nthose grouped messages serially) before any of the non-grouped\nmessages can be consumed. The functional impact in this scenario is a\ntemporary suspension of concurrent message processing while all the\ngrouped messages are processed. This can be a performance bottleneck\nso keep it in mind when determining the size of your message groups,\nand consider whether or not you should isolate your grouped messages\nfrom your non-grouped messages.\n\nUsing Core API\nThe property name used to identify the message group is \"_AMQ_GROUP_ID\"\n(or the constant MessageImpl.HDR_GROUP_ID). Alternatively, you can set\nautogroup to true on the SessionFactory which will pick a random\nunique id.\nUsing JMS\nThe property name used to identify the message group is JMSXGroupID.\n // send 2 messages in the same group to ensure the same\n // consumer will receive both\n Message message = ...\n message.setStringProperty(\"JMSXGroupID\", \"Group-0\");\n producer.send(message);\n\n message = ...\n message.setStringProperty(\"JMSXGroupID\", \"Group-0\");\n producer.send(message);\nAlternatively, you can set autogroup to true on the\nActiveMQConnectonFactory which will pick a random unique id. This can\nalso be set in the JNDI context environment, e.g. jndi.properties.\nHere's a simple example using the \"ConnectionFactory\" connection factory\nwhich is available in the context by default\njava.naming.factory.initial=org.apache.activemq.artemis.jndi.ActiveMQInitialContextFactory\nconnectionFactory.myConnectionFactory=tcp://localhost:61616?autoGroup=true\nAlternatively you can set the group id via the connection factory. All\nmessages sent with producers created via this connection factory will\nset the JMSXGroupID to the specified value on all messages sent. This\ncan also be set in the JNDI context environment, e.g. jndi.properties.\nHere's a simple example using the \"ConnectionFactory\" connection factory\nwhich is available in the context by default:\njava.naming.factory.initial=org.apache.activemq.artemis.jndi.ActiveMQInitialContextFactory\nconnectionFactory.myConnectionFactory=tcp://localhost:61616?groupID=Group-0\nExample\nSee the [examples](examples.md} chapter for an example which shows how message groups are configured and used with JMS and via a connection factory.\nClustered Grouping\nUsing message groups in a cluster is a bit more complex. This is because\nmessages with a particular group id can arrive on any node so each node\nneeds to know about which group id's are bound to which consumer on\nwhich node. The consumer handling messages for a particular group id may\nbe on a different node of the cluster, so each node needs to know this\ninformation so it can route the message correctly to the node which has\nthat consumer.\nTo solve this there is the notion of a grouping handler. Each node will\nhave its own grouping handler and when a messages is sent with a group\nid assigned, the handlers will decide between them which route the\nmessage should take.\nThere are 2 types of handlers; Local and Remote. Each cluster should\nchoose 1 node to have a local grouping handler and all the other nodes\nshould have remote handlers- it's the local handler that actually makes\nthe decision as to what route should be used, all the other remote\nhandlers converse with this. Here is a sample config for both types of\nhandler, this should be configured in the broker.xml\nfile.\n\n   LOCAL\n   jms\n   5000\n\n\n\n   REMOTE\n   jms\n   5000\n\nThe address attribute refers to a cluster connection and the address\nit uses, refer to the clustering section on how to\nconfigure clusters. The timeout attribute referees to how long to wait\nfor a decision to be made, an exception will be thrown during the send\nif this timeout is reached, this ensures that strict ordering is kept.\nThe decision as to where a message should be routed to is initially\nproposed by the node that receives the message. The node will pick a\nsuitable route as per the normal clustered routing conditions, i.e.\nround robin available queues, use a local queue first and choose a queue\nthat has a consumer. If the proposal is accepted by the grouping\nhandlers the node will route messages to this queue from that point on,\nif rejected an alternative route will be offered and the node will again\nroute to that queue indefinitely. All other nodes will also route to the\nqueue chosen at proposal time. Once the message arrives at the queue\nthen normal single server message group semantics take over and the\nmessage is pinned to a consumer on that queue.\nYou may have noticed that there is a single point of failure with the\nsingle local handler. If this node crashes then no decisions will be\nable to be made. Any messages sent will be not be delivered and an\nexception thrown. To avoid this happening Local Handlers can be\nreplicated on another backup node. Simple create your back up node and\nconfigure it with the same Local handler.\nClustered Grouping Best Practices\nSome best practices should be followed when using clustered grouping:\n\nMake sure your consumers are distributed evenly across the different\nnodes if possible. This is only an issue if you are creating and\nclosing consumers regularly. Since messages are always routed to the\nsame queue once pinned, removing a consumer from this queue may\nleave it with no consumers meaning the queue will just keep\nreceiving the messages. Avoid closing consumers or make sure that\nyou always have plenty of consumers, i.e., if you have 3 nodes have\n3 consumers.\n\nUse durable queues if possible. If queues are removed once a group\nis bound to it, then it is possible that other nodes may still try\nto route messages to it. This can be avoided by making sure that the\nqueue is deleted by the session that is sending the messages. This\nmeans that when the next message is sent it is sent to the node\nwhere the queue was deleted meaning a new proposal can successfully\ntake place. Alternatively you could just start using a different\ngroup id.\n\nAlways make sure that the node that has the Local Grouping Handler\nis replicated. These means that on failover grouping will still\noccur.\n\nIn case you are using group-timeouts, the remote node should have a\nsmaller group-timeout with at least half of the value on the main\ncoordinator. This is because this will determine how often the\nlast-time-use value should be updated with a round trip for a\nrequest to the group between the nodes.\n\n\nClustered Grouping Example\nSee the examples chapter for an example of how to configure message groups with a ActiveMQ Artemis Cluster.\n"},"pre-acknowledge.html":{"url":"pre-acknowledge.html","title":"Extra Acknowledge Modes","keywords":"","body":"Extra Acknowledge Modes\nJMS specifies 3 acknowledgement modes:\n\nAUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE\n\nCLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE\n\nDUPS_OK_ACKNOWLEDGE\n\n\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis supports two additional modes: PRE_ACKNOWLEDGE and\nINDIVIDUAL_ACKNOWLEDGE\nIn some cases you can afford to lose messages in event of failure, so it\nwould make sense to acknowledge the message on the server before\ndelivering it to the client.\nThis extra mode is supported by Apache ActiveMQ Artemis and will call it\npre-acknowledge mode.\nThe disadvantage of acknowledging on the server before delivery is that\nthe message will be lost if the system crashes after acknowledging the\nmessage on the server but before it is delivered to the client. In\nthat case, the message is lost and will not be recovered when the system\nrestart.\nDepending on your messaging case, preAcknowledgement mode can avoid\nextra network traffic and CPU at the cost of coping with message loss.\nAn example of a use case for pre-acknowledgement is for stock price\nupdate messages. With these messages it might be reasonable to lose a\nmessage in event of crash, since the next price update message will\narrive soon, overriding the previous price.\n\nNote\nPlease note, that if you use pre-acknowledge mode, then you will lose\ntransactional semantics for messages being consumed, since clearly\nthey are being acknowledged first on the server, not when you commit\nthe transaction. This may be stating the obvious but we like to be\nclear on these things to avoid confusion!\n\nUsing PRE_ACKNOWLEDGE\nThis can be configured by setting the boolean URL parameter preAcknowledge\nto true.\nAlternatively, when using the JMS API, create a JMS Session with the\nActiveMQSession.PRE_ACKNOWLEDGE constant.\n// messages will be acknowledge on the server *before* being delivered to the client\nSession session = connection.createSession(false, ActiveMQJMSConstants.PRE_ACKNOWLEDGE);\nIndividual Acknowledge\nA valid use-case for individual acknowledgement would be when you need\nto have your own scheduling and you don't know when your message\nprocessing will be finished. You should prefer having one consumer per\nthread worker but this is not possible in some circumstances depending\non how complex is your processing. For that you can use the individual\nacknowledgement.\nYou basically setup Individual ACK by creating a session with the\nacknowledge mode with ActiveMQJMSConstants.INDIVIDUAL_ACKNOWLEDGE.\nIndividual ACK inherits all the semantics from Client Acknowledge, with\nthe exception the message is individually acked.\n\nNote\nPlease note, that to avoid confusion on MDB processing, Individual\nACKNOWLEDGE is not supported through MDBs (or the inbound resource\nadapter). this is because you have to finish the process of your\nmessage inside the MDB.\n\nExample\nSee the examples chapter for an example which shows how to\nuse pre-acknowledgement mode with JMS.\n"},"management.html":{"url":"management.html","title":"Management","keywords":"","body":"Management\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis has an extensive management API that allows a user to modify a\nserver configuration, create new resources (e.g. addresses and queues),\ninspect these resources (e.g. how many messages are currently held in a\nqueue) and interact with it (e.g. to remove messages from a queue).

In summary:\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis Server Management\nThe ActiveMQServerControl interface is the entry point for broker management.\n\nListing, creating, deploying and destroying queues\nA list of deployed queues can be retrieved using the\ngetQueueNames() method.\nQueues can be created or destroyed using the management\noperations createQueue() or deployQueue() or destroyQueue()\ncreateQueue will fail if the queue already exists while\ndeployQueue will do nothing.\n\nListing and closing remote connections\nClient's remote addresses can be retrieved using\nlistRemoteAddresses(). It is also possible to close the\nconnections associated with a remote address using the\ncloseConnectionsForAddress() method.\nAlternatively, connection IDs can be listed using\nlistConnectionIDs() and all the sessions for a given connection ID\ncan be listed using listSessions().\n\nTransaction heuristic operations\nIn case of a server crash, when the server restarts, it it possible\nthat some transaction requires manual intervention. The\nlistPreparedTransactions() method lists the transactions which are\nin the prepared states (the transactions are represented as opaque\nBase64 Strings.) To commit or rollback a given prepared transaction,\nthe commitPreparedTransaction() or rollbackPreparedTransaction()\nmethod can be used to resolve heuristic transactions. Heuristically\ncompleted transactions can be listed using the\nlistHeuristicCommittedTransactions() and\nlistHeuristicRolledBackTransactions methods.\n\nEnabling and resetting Message counters\nMessage counters can be enabled or disabled using the\nenableMessageCounters() or disableMessageCounters() method. To\nreset message counters, it is possible to invoke\nresetAllMessageCounters() and resetAllMessageCounterHistories()\nmethods.\n\nRetrieving the server configuration and attributes\nThe ActiveMQServerControl exposes Apache ActiveMQ Artemis server configuration\nthrough all its attributes (e.g. getVersion() method to retrieve\nthe server's version, etc.)\n\nListing, creating and destroying Core bridges and diverts\nA list of deployed core bridges (resp. diverts) can be retrieved\nusing the getBridgeNames() (resp. getDivertNames()) method.\nCore bridges (resp. diverts) can be created or destroyed using the\nmanagement operations createBridge() and destroyBridge() (resp.\ncreateDivert() and destroyDivert()).\n\nIt is possible to stop the server and force failover to occur with\nany currently attached clients.\nTo do this use the forceFailover() operation. \n\nNote\nSince this method actually stops the server you will probably\nreceive some sort of error depending on which management service\nyou use to call it.\n\n\n\nAddress Management\nIndividual addresses can be managed using the AddressControl interface.\n\nModifying roles and permissions for an address\nYou can add or remove roles associated to a queue using the\naddRole() or removeRole() methods. You can list all the roles\nassociated to the queue with the getRoles() method\n\n\nQueue Management\nThe bulk of the management API deals with queues. The\nQueueControl interface defines the queue management operations.\nMost of the management operations on queues take either a single message\nID (e.g. to remove a single message) or a filter (e.g. to expire all\nmessages with a given property.)\n\nNote\nPassing null or an empty string in the filter parameter means that\nthe management operation will be performed on all messages in a queue.\n\n\nExpiring, sending to a dead letter address and moving messages\nMessages can be expired from a queue by using the expireMessages()\nmethod. If an expiry address is defined, messages will be sent to\nit, otherwise they are discarded. The queue's expiry address can be\nset with the setExpiryAddress() method.\nMessages can also be sent to a dead letter address with the\nsendMessagesToDeadLetterAddress() method. It returns the number of\nmessages which are sent to the dead letter address. If a dead letter\naddress is not defined, message are removed from the queue and\ndiscarded. The queue's dead letter address can be set with the\nsetDeadLetterAddress() method.\nMessages can also be moved from a queue to another queue by using\nthe moveMessages() method.\n\nListing and removing messages\nMessages can be listed from a queue by using the listMessages()\nmethod which returns an array of Map, one Map for each message.\nMessages can also be removed from the queue by using the\nremoveMessages() method which returns a boolean for the single\nmessage ID variant or the number of removed messages for the filter\nvariant. The removeMessages() method takes a filter argument to\nremove only filtered messages. Setting the filter to an empty string\nwill in effect remove all messages.\n\nCounting messages\nThe number of messages in a queue is returned by the\ngetMessageCount() method. Alternatively, the countMessages()\nwill return the number of messages in the queue which match a given\nfilter.\n\nChanging message priority\nThe message priority can be changed by using the\nchangeMessagesPriority() method which returns a boolean for the\nsingle message ID variant or the number of updated messages for the\nfilter variant.\n\nMessage counters\nMessage counters can be listed for a queue with the\nlistMessageCounter() and listMessageCounterHistory() methods\n(see Message Counters section). The message counters can also be\nreset for a single queue using the resetMessageCounter() method.\n\nRetrieving the queue attributes\nThe QueueControl exposes queue settings through its\nattributes (e.g. getFilter() to retrieve the queue's filter if it\nwas created with one, isDurable() to know whether the queue is\ndurable or not, etc.)\n\nPausing and resuming Queues\nThe QueueControl can pause and resume the underlying queue. When a\nqueue is paused, it will receive messages but will not deliver them.\nWhen it's resumed, it'll begin delivering the queued messages, if\nany.\n\n\nOther Resources Management\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis allows to start and stop its remote resources (acceptors,\ndiverts, bridges, etc.) so that a server can be taken off line for a\ngiven period of time without stopping it completely (e.g. if other\nmanagement operations must be performed such as resolving heuristic\ntransactions). These resources are:\n\nAcceptors\nThey can be started or stopped using the start() or. stop()\nmethod on the AcceptorControl interface. The acceptors parameters\ncan be retrieved using the AcceptorControl attributes (see Understanding Acceptors)\n\nDiverts\nThey can be started or stopped using the start() or stop()\nmethod on the DivertControl interface. Diverts\nparameters can be retrieved using the DivertControl attributes\n(see Diverting and Splitting Message Flows))\n\nBridges\nThey can be started or stopped using the start() (resp. stop())\nmethod on the BridgeControl interface. Bridges parameters can be retrieved\nusing the BridgeControl attributes (see Core bridges)\n\nBroadcast groups\nThey can be started or stopped using the start() or stop()\nmethod on the BroadcastGroupControl interface. Broadcast groups\nparameters can be retrieved using the BroadcastGroupControl\nattributes (see Clusters)\n\nCluster connections\nThey can be started or stopped using the start() or stop()\nmethod on the ClusterConnectionControl interface. Cluster\nconnections parameters can be retrieved using the\nClusterConnectionControl attributes (see Clusters)\n\n\nUsing Management Via JMX\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis can be managed using\nJMX.\nThe management API is exposed by Apache ActiveMQ Artemis using MBeans interfaces.\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis registers its resources with the domain org.apache.activemq.artemis.\nFor example, the ObjectName to manage the anycast queue exampleQueue on the address exampleAddress is:\norg.apache.activemq.artemis:broker=,component=addresses,address=\"exampleAddress\",subcomponent=queues,routing-type=\"anycast\",queue=\"exampleQueue\"\nand the MBean is:\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.api.core.management.QueueControl\nThe MBean ObjectName's are built using the helper class\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.api.core.management.ObjectNameBuilder. You can\nalso use jconsole to find the ObjectName of the MBean you want to\nmanage.\nExample usage of the ObjectNameBuilder to obtain ActiveMQServerControl's name:\nbrokerName = \"0.0.0.0\";  // configured e.g. in broker.xml  element\nobjectNameBuilder = ObjectNameBuilder.create(ArtemisResolver.DEFAULT_DOMAIN, brokerName, true);\nserverObjectName = objectNameBuilder.getActiveMQServerObjectName()\n\nManaging Apache ActiveMQ Artemis using JMX is identical to management of any Java\nApplications using JMX. It can be done by reflection or by creating\nproxies of the MBeans.\nConfiguring JMX\nBy default, JMX is enabled to manage Apache ActiveMQ Artemis. It can be disabled by\nsetting jmx-management-enabled to false in\nbroker.xml:\n\nfalse\nRole Based Authentication with JMX\nAlthough by default Artemis uses the Java Virtual Machine's Platform MBeanServer \nthis is guarded using role based authentication that leverages Artemis's JAAS plugin support.\nThis is configured via the authorisation element in the management.xml configuration file\nand can be used to restrict access to attributes and methods on mbeans.\nThere are 3 elements within the authorisation element, whitelist, default-access and \nrole-access, Lets discuss each in turn.\nWhitelist contains a list of mBeans that will by pass the authentication, this is typically\nused for any mbeans that are needed by the console to run etc. The default configuration is:\n\n   \n\n\nThis means that any mbean with the domain hawtio will be allowed access without authorisation. for instance \nhawtio:plugin=artemis. You can also use wildcards for the mBean properties so the following would also match.\n\n   \n\n\nThe role-accessdefines how roles are mapped to particular mBeans and its attributes and methods, \nthe default configuration looks like:\n\n    \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n    \n\n\nThis contains 1 match and will be applied to any mBean that has the domain org.apache.activemq.apache.\nAny access to any mBeans that have this domain are controlled by the access elements which contain a\nmethod and a set of roles. The method being invoked will be used to pick the closest matching method and\nthe roles for this will be applied for access. For instance if you try the invoke a method called listMessages on an mBean \nwith the org.apache.activemq.apache domain then this would match the access with the method of list*.\nYou could also explicitly configure this by using the full method name, like so:\n\n\nYou can also match specific mBeans within a domain by adding a key attribute that is used to match one of the properties\non the mBean, like:\n\n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n\n\nYou could also match a specific queue for instance :\norg.apache.activemq.artemis:broker=,component=addresses,address=\"exampleAddress\",subcomponent=queues,routing-type=\"anycast\",queue=\"exampleQueue\"\nby configuring:\n\n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n\n\nAccess to JMX mBean attributes are converted to method calls so these are controlled via the set*, get* and is*. \nThe * access is the catch all for everything other method that isnt specifically matched.\nThe default-access element is basically the catch all for every method call that isn't handled via the role-access configuration.\nThis has teh same semantics as a match element.\n\nNote\nIf JMX is enabled, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis can not be managed locally using jconsole when connecting as a local process,\nthis is because jconsole does not using any authentication when connecting this way. If you want to use jconsole you will\neither have to disable authentication, by removing the authentication element or enable remote access.\n\nConfiguring remote JMX Access\nBy default remote JMX access to Artemis is disabled for security reasons.\nArtemis has a JMX agent which allows access to JMX mBeans remotely. This is configured via the connector element in the\nmanagement.xml configuration file. To enable this you simpl ad the following xml:\n\n\nThis exposes the agent remotely on the port 1099. If you were connecting via jconsole you would connect as a remote process\nusing the service url service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:1099/jmxrmi and an appropriate user name and password.\nYou can also configure the connector using the following:\n\nconnector-host \nThe host to expose the agent on\n\nconnector-port \nThe port to expose the agent on \n\njmx-realm \nThe jmx realm to use for authentication, defaults to activemq to match the JAAS configuration.\n\nobject-name \nThe object name to expose the remote connector on, default is connector:name=rmi\n\nsecured \nWhether the connector is secured using SSL\n\nkey-store-path \nThe location of the keystore\n\nkey-store-password \nThe keystore password\n\nkey-store-provider \nThe provider, JKS by default\ntrust-store-path \nThe location of the truststore \n\ntrust-store-password \nThe trustore password\n\ntrust-store-provider \nThe provider, JKS by default\n\n\n\nNote\nIt is important to note that the rmi registry will pick an ip address to bind to, If you have a multi IP addresses/NICspresent on the system then you can choose the ip address to use by adding the following to artemis.profile \n-Djava.rmi.server.hostname=localhost\nNote\nRemote connections using the default JVM Agent not enabled by default as Artemis exposes the mBean Server via its own configuration. \nThis is so Artemis can leverage the JAAS authentication layer via JMX. If you want to expose this then you will need to \ndisable both the connector and the authorisation by removing them from the management.xml configuration.\nPlease refer to Java Management guide\nto configure the server for remote management (system properties must be set in artemis.profile).\n\nBy default, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis server uses the JMX domain \"org.apache.activemq.artemis\".\nTo manage several Apache ActiveMQ Artemis servers from the same MBeanServer, the JMX\ndomain can be configured for each individual Apache ActiveMQ Artemis server by setting\njmx-domain in broker.xml:\n\nmy.org.apache.activemq\nExample\nSee the Examples chapter for an example which shows how to use a remote connection to JMX\nand MBean proxies to manage Apache ActiveMQ Artemis.\nExposing JMX using Jolokia\nThe default Broker configuration ships with the Jolokia\nHTTP agent deployed as a Web Application. Jolokia is a remote\nJMX-over-HTTP bridge that exposes MBeans. For a full guide as\nto how to use it refer to Jolokia Documentation,\nhowever a simple example to query the broker's version would\nbe to use a browser and go to the URL http://username:password@localhost:8161/console/jolokia/read/org.apache.activemq.artemis:broker=\"0.0.0.0\"/Version.\nThis would give you back something like the following:\n{\"request\":{\"mbean\":\"org.apache.activemq.artemis:broker=\\\"0.0.0.0\\\"\",\"attribute\":\"Version\",\"type\":\"read\"},\"value\":\"2.0.0-SNAPSHOT\",\"timestamp\":1487017918,\"status\":200}\nJMX and the Console\nThe console that ships with Artemis uses Jolokia under the covers which in turn uses JMX. This will use the authentication\nconfiguration in the management.xml file as described in the previous section. This means that when mBeans are accessed\nvia the console the credentials used to log into the console and the roles associated with them. By default access to the \nconsole is only allow via users with the amq role. This is configured in the artemis.profile via the system property -Dhawtio.role=amq.\nYou can configure multiple roles by changing this to -Dhawtio.roles=amq,view,update.\nIf a user doesn't have the correct role to invoke a specific operation then this will display an authorisation exception \nin the console. \nUsing Management Via Apache ActiveMQ Artemis API\nThe management API in ActiveMQ Artemis is accessed by sending Core Client messages\nto a special address, the management address.\nManagement messages are regular Core Client messages with well-known\nproperties that the server needs to understand to interact with the\nmanagement API:\n\nThe name of the managed resource\n\nThe name of the management operation\n\nThe parameters of the management operation\n\n\nWhen such a management message is sent to the management address,\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis server will handle it, extract the information, invoke the\noperation on the managed resources and send a management reply to the\nmanagement message's reply-to address (specified by\nClientMessageImpl.REPLYTO_HEADER_NAME).\nA ClientConsumer can be used to consume the management reply and\nretrieve the result of the operation (if any) stored in the reply's\nbody. For portability, results are returned as a JSON\nString rather than Java Serialization (the\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.api.core.management.ManagementHelper can be used\nto convert the JSON string to Java objects).\nThese steps can be simplified to make it easier to invoke management\noperations using Core messages:\n\nCreate a ClientRequestor to send messages to the management\naddress and receive replies\n\nCreate a ClientMessage\n\nUse the helper class\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.api.core.management.ManagementHelper to fill\nthe message with the management properties\n\nSend the message using the ClientRequestor\n\nUse the helper class\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.api.core.management.ManagementHelper to\nretrieve the operation result from the management reply\n\n\nFor example, to find out the number of messages in the queue\nexampleQueue:\nClientSession session = ...\nClientRequestor requestor = new ClientRequestor(session, \"activemq.management\");\nClientMessage message = session.createMessage(false);\nManagementHelper.putAttribute(message, \"queue.exampleQueue\", \"messageCount\");\nsession.start();\nClientMessage reply = requestor.request(m);\nint count = (Integer) ManagementHelper.getResult(reply);\nSystem.out.println(\"There are \" + count + \" messages in exampleQueue\");\n\nManagement operation name and parameters must conform to the Java\ninterfaces defined in the management packages.\nNames of the resources are built using the helper class\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.api.core.management.ResourceNames and are\nstraightforward (e.g. queue.exampleQueue for QueueControl of the Queue\nexampleQueue, or broker for the ActiveMQServerControl).\n\nNOTE\nThe ManagementHelper class can be used only with Core JMS messages.\nWhen called with a message from a different JMS library, an exception will be thrown.\n\nConfiguring Management\nThe management address to send management messages is configured in\nbroker.xml:\nactivemq.management\nBy default, the address is activemq.management.\nThe management address requires a special user permission manage to\nbe able to receive and handle management messages. This is also\nconfigured in broker.xml:\n\n\n\n   \n\nExample\nSee the Examples chapter for an example which shows\nhow to use JMS messages to manage the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis server.\nManagement Notifications\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis emits notifications to inform listeners of potentially\ninteresting events (creation of new resources, security violation,\netc.).\nThese notifications can be received by two different ways:\n\nJMX notifications\n\nNotification messages\n\n\nJMX Notifications\nIf JMX is enabled (see Configuring JMX section), JMX notifications can be received by\nsubscribing to org.apache.activemq.artemis:type=Broker,brokerName=,module=Core,serviceType=Server for\nnotifications on resources.\nNotification Messages\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis defines a special management notification address. \nQueues can be bound to this address so that clients will receive\nmanagement notifications as messages.\nA client which wants to receive management notifications must\ncreate a queue bound to the management notification address. It can\nthen receive the notifications from its queue.\nNotifications messages are regular messages with additional\nproperties corresponding to the notification (its type, when it\noccurred, the resources which were concerned, etc.).\nSince notifications are regular messages, it is possible to use\nmessage selectors to filter out notifications and receives only a subset\nof all the notifications emitted by the server.\nConfiguring The Management Notification Address\nThe management notification address to receive management notifications\nis configured in broker.xml:\nactivemq.notifications\nBy default, the address is activemq.notifications.\nReceiving Notification Messages\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis's Core JMS Client can be used to receive notifications:\nTopic notificationsTopic = ActiveMQJMSClient.createTopic(\"activemq.notifications\");\n\nSession session = ...\nMessageConsumer notificationConsumer = session.createConsumer(notificationsTopic);\nnotificationConsumer.setMessageListener(new MessageListener()\n{\n   public void onMessage(Message notif)\n   {\n      System.out.println(\"------------------------\");\n      System.out.println(\"Received notification:\");\n      try\n      {\n         Enumeration propertyNames = notif.getPropertyNames();\n         while (propertyNames.hasMoreElements())\n         {\n            String propertyName = (String)propertyNames.nextElement();\n            System.out.format(\"  %s: %s\\n\", propertyName, notif.getObjectProperty(propertyName));\n         }\n      }\n      catch (JMSException e)\n      {\n      }\n      System.out.println(\"------------------------\");\n   }\n});\n\nExample\nSee the Examples chapter for an example which shows how to use a JMS MessageListener to receive management notifications from ActiveMQ Artemis server.\nNotification Types and Headers\nBelow is a list of all the different kinds of notifications as well as\nwhich headers are on the messages. Every notification has a\n_AMQ_NotifType (value noted in parentheses) and _AMQ_NotifTimestamp\nheader. The timestamp is the un-formatted result of a call to\njava.lang.System.currentTimeMillis().\n\nBINDING_ADDED (0)\n_AMQ_Binding_Type, _AMQ_Address, _AMQ_ClusterName,\n_AMQ_RoutingName, _AMQ_Binding_ID, _AMQ_Distance,\n_AMQ_FilterString\n\nBINDING_REMOVED (1)\n_AMQ_Address, _AMQ_ClusterName, _AMQ_RoutingName,\n_AMQ_Binding_ID, _AMQ_Distance, _AMQ_FilterString\n\nCONSUMER_CREATED (2)\n_AMQ_Address, _AMQ_ClusterName, _AMQ_RoutingName, _AMQ_Distance,\n_AMQ_ConsumerCount, _AMQ_User, _AMQ_RemoteAddress,\n_AMQ_SessionName, _AMQ_FilterString\n\nCONSUMER_CLOSED (3)\n_AMQ_Address, _AMQ_ClusterName, _AMQ_RoutingName, _AMQ_Distance,\n_AMQ_ConsumerCount, _AMQ_User, _AMQ_RemoteAddress,\n_AMQ_SessionName, _AMQ_FilterString\n\nSECURITY_AUTHENTICATION_VIOLATION (6)\n_AMQ_User\n\nSECURITY_PERMISSION_VIOLATION (7)\n_AMQ_Address, _AMQ_CheckType, _AMQ_User\n\nDISCOVERY_GROUP_STARTED (8)\nname\n\nDISCOVERY_GROUP_STOPPED (9)\nname\n\nBROADCAST_GROUP_STARTED (10)\nname\n\nBROADCAST_GROUP_STOPPED (11)\nname\n\nBRIDGE_STARTED (12)\nname\n\nBRIDGE_STOPPED (13)\nname\n\nCLUSTER_CONNECTION_STARTED (14)\nname\n\nCLUSTER_CONNECTION_STOPPED (15)\nname\n\nACCEPTOR_STARTED (16)\nfactory, id\n\nACCEPTOR_STOPPED (17)\nfactory, id\n\nPROPOSAL (18)\n_JBM_ProposalGroupId, _JBM_ProposalValue, _AMQ_Binding_Type,\n_AMQ_Address, _AMQ_Distance\n\nPROPOSAL_RESPONSE (19)\n_JBM_ProposalGroupId, _JBM_ProposalValue,\n_JBM_ProposalAltValue, _AMQ_Binding_Type, _AMQ_Address,\n_AMQ_Distance\n\nCONSUMER_SLOW (21)\n_AMQ_Address, _AMQ_ConsumerCount, _AMQ_RemoteAddress,\n_AMQ_ConnectionName, _AMQ_ConsumerName, _AMQ_SessionName\n\n\nMessage Counters\nMessage counters can be used to obtain information on queues over time\nas Apache ActiveMQ Artemis keeps a history on queue metrics.\nThey can be used to show trends on queues. For example, using the\nmanagement API, it would be possible to query the number of messages in\na queue at regular interval. However, this would not be enough to know\nif the queue is used: the number of messages can remain constant because\nnobody is sending or receiving messages from the queue or because there\nare as many messages sent to the queue than messages consumed from it.\nThe number of messages in the queue remains the same in both cases but\nits use is widely different.\nMessage counters give additional information about the queues:\n\ncount\nThe total number of messages added to the queue since the server\nwas started\n\ncountDelta\nthe number of messages added to the queue since the last message\ncounter update\n\nmessageCount\nThe current number of messages in the queue\n\nmessageCountDelta\nThe overall number of messages added/removed from the queue since\nthe last message counter update. For example, if\nmessageCountDelta is equal to -10 this means that overall 10\nmessages have been removed from the queue (e.g. 2 messages were\nadded and 12 were removed)\n\nlastAddTimestamp\nThe timestamp of the last time a message was added to the queue\n\nudpateTimestamp\nThe timestamp of the last message counter update\n\n\nThese attributes can be used to determine other meaningful data as well.\nFor example, to know specifically how many messages were consumed from\nthe queue since the last update simply subtract the messageCountDelta\nfrom countDelta.\nConfiguring Message Counters\nBy default, message counters are disabled as it might have a small\nnegative effect on memory.\nTo enable message counters, you can set it to true in\nbroker.xml:\ntrue\nMessage counters keep a history of the queue metrics (10 days by\ndefault) and sample all the queues at regular interval (10 seconds by\ndefault). If message counters are enabled, these values should be\nconfigured to suit your messaging use case in\nbroker.xml:\n\n7\n\n60000\nMessage counters can be retrieved using the Management API. For example,\nto retrieve message counters on a queue using JMX:\n// retrieve a connection to Apache ActiveMQ Artemis's MBeanServer\nMBeanServerConnection mbsc = ...\nQueueControlMBean queueControl = (QueueControl)MBeanServerInvocationHandler.newProxyInstance(mbsc,\n   on,\n   QueueControl.class,\n   false);\n// message counters are retrieved as a JSON String\nString counters = queueControl.listMessageCounter();\n// use the MessageCounterInfo helper class to manipulate message counters more easily\nMessageCounterInfo messageCounter = MessageCounterInfo.fromJSON(counters);\nSystem.out.format(\"%s message(s) in the queue (since last sample: %s)\\n\",\nmessageCounter.getMessageCount(),\nmessageCounter.getMessageCountDelta());\n\nExample\nSee the Examples chapter for an example which shows how to use message counters to retrieve information on a queue.\n"},"management-console.html":{"url":"management-console.html","title":"Management Console","keywords":"","body":"Management Console\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis ships by default with a management console.

To disable security completely simply set the\nsecurity-enabled property to false in the broker.xml\nfile.\nFor performance reasons security is cached and invalidated every so\nlong. To change this period set the property\nsecurity-invalidation-interval, which is in milliseconds. The default\nis 10000 ms.\nTo assist in security auditing the populate-validated-user option exists. If this is true then\nthe server will add the name of the validated user to the message using the key _AMQ_VALIDATED_USER.\nFor JMS and Stomp clients this is mapped to the key JMSXUserID.

If security-enabled\nis false and populate-validated-user is true then the server will simply use whatever user name\n(if any) the client provides. This option is false by default.\nRole based security for addresses\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis contains a flexible role-based security model for applying\nsecurity to queues, based on their addresses.\nAs explained in Using Core, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis core consists mainly of sets of queues bound\nto addresses. A message is sent to an address and the server looks up\nthe set of queues that are bound to that address, the server then routes\nthe message to those set of queues.\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis allows sets of permissions to be defined against the queues\nbased on their address. An exact match on the address can be used or a\nwildcard match can be used using the wildcard characters '#' and\n'*'.\nEight different permissions can be given to the set of queues which\nmatch the address. Those permissions are:\n\ncreateDurableQueue. This permission allows the user to create a\ndurable queue under matching addresses.\n\ndeleteDurableQueue. This permission allows the user to delete a\ndurable queue under matching addresses.\n\ncreateNonDurableQueue. This permission allows the user to create a\nnon-durable queue under matching addresses.\n\ndeleteNonDurableQueue. This permission allows the user to delete a\nnon-durable queue under matching addresses.\n\nsend. This permission allows the user to send a message to\nmatching addresses.\n\nconsume. This permission allows the user to consume a message from\na queue bound to matching addresses.\n\nbrowse. This permission allows the user to browse a queue bound to\nthe matching address.\n\nmanage. This permission allows the user to invoke management\noperations by sending management messages to the management address.\n\n\nFor each permission, a list of roles who are granted that permission is\nspecified. If the user has any of those roles, he/she will be granted\nthat permission for that set of addresses.\nLet's take a simple example, here's a security block from\nbroker.xml file:\n\n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n\nThe '#' character signifies \"any sequence of words\". Words are\ndelimited by the '.' character. For a full description of the wildcard\nsyntax please see Understanding the Wildcard Syntax.\nThe above security block applies to any address\nthat starts with the string \"globalqueues.europe.\":\nOnly users who have the admin role can create or delete durable queues\nbound to an address that starts with the string \"globalqueues.europe.\"\nAny users with the roles admin, guest, or europe-users can create\nor delete temporary queues bound to an address that starts with the\nstring \"globalqueues.europe.\"\nAny users with the roles admin or europe-users can send messages to\nthese addresses or consume messages from queues bound to an address that\nstarts with the string \"globalqueues.europe.\"\nThe mapping between a user and what roles they have is handled by the\nsecurity manager. Apache ActiveMQ Artemis ships with a user manager that reads user\ncredentials from a file on disk, and can also plug into JAAS or JBoss\nApplication Server security.\nFor more information on configuring the security manager, please see 'Changing the Security Manager'.\nThere can be zero or more security-setting elements in each xml file.\nWhere more than one match applies to a set of addresses the more\nspecific match takes precedence.\nLet's look at an example of that, here's another security-setting\nblock:\n\n   \n   \n\nIn this security-setting block the match\n'globalqueues.europe.orders.#' is more specific than the previous match\n'globalqueues.europe.#'. So any addresses which match\n'globalqueues.europe.orders.#' will take their security settings only\nfrom the latter security-setting block.\nNote that settings are not inherited from the former block. All the\nsettings will be taken from the more specific matching block, so for the\naddress 'globalqueues.europe.orders.plastics' the only permissions that\nexist are send and consume for the role europe-users. The\npermissions createDurableQueue, deleteDurableQueue,\ncreateNonDurableQueue, deleteNonDurableQueue are not inherited from\nthe other security-setting block.\nBy not inheriting permissions, it allows you to effectively deny\npermissions in more specific security-setting blocks by simply not\nspecifying them. Otherwise it would not be possible to deny permissions\nin sub-groups of addresses.\nSecurity Setting Plugin\nAside from configuring sets of permissions via XML these permissions can alternatively be\nconfigured via a plugin which implements org.apache.activemq.artemis.core.server.SecuritySettingPlugin e.g.:\n\n   \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n   \n\nMost of this configuration is specific to the plugin implementation. However, there are two configuration details that\nwill be specified for every implementation:\n\nclass-name. This attribute of security-setting-plugin indicates the name of the class which implements\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.core.server.SecuritySettingPlugin.\n\nsetting. Each of these elements represents a name/value pair that will be passed to the implementation for configuration\npurposes.\n\n\nSee the JavaDoc on org.apache.activemq.artemis.core.server.SecuritySettingPlugin for further details about the interface\nand what each method is expected to do.\nAvailable plugins\nLegacyLDAPSecuritySettingPlugin\nThis plugin will read the security information that was previously handled by LDAPAuthorizationMap\nand the cachedLDAPAuthorizationMap in Apache ActiveMQ 5.x\nand turn it into Artemis security settings where possible. The security implementations of ActiveMQ 5.x and Artemis don't\nmatch perfectly so some translation must occur to achieve near equivalent functionality.\nHere is an example of the plugin's configuration:\n\n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n\n\nclass-name. The implementation is org.apache.activemq.artemis.core.server.impl.LegacyLDAPSecuritySettingPlugin.\n\ninitialContextFactory. The initial context factory used to connect to LDAP. It must always be set to\ncom.sun.jndi.ldap.LdapCtxFactory (i.e. the default value).\n\nconnectionURL. Specifies the location of the directory server using an ldap URL, ldap://Host:Port. You can\noptionally qualify this URL, by adding a forward slash, /, followed by the DN of a particular node in the directory\ntree. For example, ldap://ldapserver:10389/ou=system. The default is ldap://localhost:1024.\n\nconnectionUsername. The DN of the user that opens the connection to the directory server. For example, uid=admin,ou=system.\nDirectory servers generally require clients to present username/password credentials in order to open a connection.\n\nconnectionPassword. The password that matches the DN from connectionUsername. In the directory server, in the\nDIT, the password is normally stored as a userPassword attribute in the corresponding directory entry.\n\nconnectionProtocol. Currently the only supported value is a blank string. In future, this option will allow you to\nselect the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) for the connection to the directory server. Note: this option must be set\nexplicitly to an empty string, because it has no default value.\n\nauthentication. Specifies the authentication method used when binding to the LDAP server. Can take either of the\n values, simple (username and password, the default value) or none (anonymous). Note: Simple Authentication and\n Security Layer (SASL) authentication is currently not supported.\n\ndestinationBase. Specifies the DN of the node whose children provide the permissions for all destinations. In this\ncase the DN is a literal value (that is, no string substitution is performed on the property value).  For example, a\ntypical value of this property is ou=destinations,o=ActiveMQ,ou=system (i.e. the default value).\n\nfilter. Specifies an LDAP search filter, which is used when looking up the permissions for any kind of destination.\nThe search filter attempts to match one of the children or descendants of the queue or topic node. The default value\nis (cn=*).\n\nroleAttribute. Specifies an attribute of the node matched by filter, whose value is the DN of a role. Default\nvalue is uniqueMember.\n\nadminPermissionValue. Specifies a value that matches the admin permission. The default value is admin.\n\nreadPermissionValue. Specifies a value that matches the read permission. The default value is read.\n\nwritePermissionValue. Specifies a value that matches the write permission. The default value is write.\n\nenableListener. Whether or not to enable a listener that will automatically receive updates made in the LDAP server\nand update the broker's authorization configuration in real-time. The default value is true.\n\n\nThe name of the queue or topic defined in LDAP will serve as the \"match\" for the security-setting, the permission value\nwill be mapped from the ActiveMQ 5.x type to the Artemis type, and the role will be mapped as-is.\nActiveMQ 5.x only has 3 permission types - read, write, and admin. These permission types are described on their\nwebsite. However, as described previously, ActiveMQ Artemis has 7 permission\ntypes - createDurableQueue, deleteDurableQueue, createNonDurableQueue, deleteNonDurableQueue, send, consume,\nbrowse, and manage. Here's how the old types are mapped to the new types:\n\nread - consume, browse\nwrite - send\nadmin - createDurableQueue, deleteDurableQueue, createNonDurableQueue, deleteNonDurableQueue\n\nAs mentioned, there are a few places where a translation was performed to achieve some equivalence.:\n\nThis mapping doesn't include the Artemis manage permission type since there is no type analogous for that in ActiveMQ\n5.x.\n\nThe admin permission in ActiveMQ 5.x relates to whether or not the broker will auto-create a destination if\nit doesn't exist and the user sends a message to it. Artemis automatically allows the automatic creation of a\ndestination if the user has permission to send message to it. Therefore, the plugin will map the admin permission\nto the 4 aforementioned permissions in Artemis.\n\n\nSecure Sockets Layer (SSL) Transport\nWhen messaging clients are connected to servers, or servers are connected to other servers (e.g. via bridges) over an\nuntrusted network then Apache ActiveMQ Artemis allows that traffic to be encrypted using the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)\ntransport.\nFor more information on configuring the SSL transport, please see Configuring the Transport.\nUser credentials\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis ships with two security manager implementations:\n\nThe legacy, deprecated ActiveMQSecurityManager that reads user credentials, i.e. user names, passwords and role\ninformation from properties files on the classpath called artemis-users.properties and artemis-roles.properties.\n\nThe flexible, pluggable ActiveMQJAASSecurityManager which supports any standard JAAS login module. Artemis ships\nwith several login modules which will be discussed further down. This is the default security manager.\n\n\nJAAS Security Manager\nWhen using the Java Authentication and Authorization Service (JAAS) much of the configuration depends on which login\nmodule is used. However, there are a few commonalities for every case.\nThe first place to look is in bootstrap.xml. Here is an example using the PropertiesLogin JAAS login\nmodule which reads user, password, and role information from properties files:\n\nNo matter what login module you're using, you'll need to specify it here in bootstrap.xml. The domain attribute\nhere refers to the relevant login module entry in login.config. For example:\nPropertiesLogin {\n    org.apache.activemq.artemis.spi.core.security.jaas.PropertiesLoginModule required\n        debug=true\n        org.apache.activemq.jaas.properties.user=\"artemis-users.properties\"\n        org.apache.activemq.jaas.properties.role=\"artemis-roles.properties\";\n};\nThe login.config file is a standard JAAS configuration file. You can read more about this file on\nOracle's website.\nIn short, the file defines:\n\nan alias for an entry (e.g. PropertiesLogin)\n\nthe implementation class for the login module (e.g. org.apache.activemq.artemis.spi.core.security.jaas.PropertiesLoginModule)\n\na flag which indicates whether the success of the login module is required, requisite, sufficient, or optional\n(see more details on these flags in the JavaDoc\n\na list of configuration options specific to the login module implementation\n\n\nBy default, the location and name of login.config is specified on the Artemis command-line which is set by\netc/artemis.profile on linux and etc\\artemis.profile.cmd on Windows.\nDual Authentication\nThe JAAS Security Manager also supports another configuration parameter - certificate-domain. This is useful when you\nwant to authenticate clients connecting with SSL connections based on their SSL certificates (e.g. using the CertificateLoginModule\ndiscussed below) but you still want to authenticate clients connecting with non-SSL connections with, e.g., username and\npassword. Here's an example of what would go in bootstrap.xml:\n\nAnd here's the corresponding login.config:\nPropertiesLogin {\n   org.apache.activemq.artemis.spi.core.security.jaas.PropertiesLoginModule required\n       debug=false\n       org.apache.activemq.jaas.properties.user=\"artemis-users.properties\"\n       org.apache.activemq.jaas.properties.role=\"artemis-roles.properties\";\n};\n\nCertLogin {\n   org.apache.activemq.artemis.spi.core.security.jaas.TextFileCertificateLoginModule required\n       debug=true\n       org.apache.activemq.jaas.textfiledn.user=\"cert-users.properties\"\n       org.apache.activemq.jaas.textfiledn.role=\"cert-roles.properties\";\n};\nWhen the broker is configured this way then any client connecting with SSL and a client certificate will be authenticated\nusing CertLogin and any client connecting without SSL will be authenticated using PropertiesLogin.\nJAAS Login Modules\nGuestLoginModule\nAllows users without credentials (and, depending on how it is configured, possibly also users with invalid credentials)\nto access the broker. Normally, the guest login module is chained with another login module, such as a properties login\nmodule. It is implemented by org.apache.activemq.artemis.spi.core.security.jaas.GuestLoginModule.\n\norg.apache.activemq.jaas.guest.user - the user name to assign; default is \"guest\"\n\norg.apache.activemq.jaas.guest.role - the role name to assign; default is \"guests\"\n\ncredentialsInvalidate - boolean flag; if true, reject login requests that include a password (i.e. guest login\nsucceeds only when the user does not provide a password); default is false\n\ndebug - boolean flag; if true, enable debugging; this is used only for testing or debugging; normally, it\nshould be set to false, or omitted; default is false\n\n\nThere are two basic use cases for the guest login module, as follows:\n\nGuests with no credentials or invalid credentials.\n\nGuests with no credentials only.\n\n\nThe following snippet shows how to configure a JAAS login entry for the use case where users with no credentials or\ninvalid credentials are logged in as guests. In this example, the guest login module is used in combination with the\nproperties login module.\nactivemq-domain {\n  org.apache.activemq.artemis.spi.core.security.jaas.PropertiesLoginModule sufficient\n      debug=true\n      org.apache.activemq.jaas.properties.user=\"artemis-users.properties\"\n      org.apache.activemq.jaas.properties.role=\"artemis-roles.properties\";\n\n  org.apache.activemq.artemis.spi.core.security.jaas.GuestLoginModule sufficient\n      debug=true\n      org.apache.activemq.jaas.guest.user=\"anyone\"\n      org.apache.activemq.jaas.guest.role=\"restricted\";\n};\nDepending on the user login data, authentication proceeds as follows:\n\nUser logs in with a valid password — the properties login module successfully authenticates the user and returns\nimmediately. The guest login module is not invoked.\n\nUser logs in with an invalid password — the properties login module fails to authenticate the user, and authentication\nproceeds to the guest login module. The guest login module successfully authenticates the user and returns the guest principal.\n\nUser logs in with a blank password — the properties login module fails to authenticate the user, and authentication\nproceeds to the guest login module. The guest login module successfully authenticates the user and returns the guest principal.\n\n\nThe following snipped shows how to configure a JAAS login entry for the use case where only those users with no\ncredentials are logged in as guests. To support this use case, you must set the credentialsInvalidate option to true in\nthe configuration of the guest login module. You should also note that, compared with the preceding example, the order\nof the login modules is reversed and the flag attached to the properties login module is changed to requisite.\nactivemq-guest-when-no-creds-only-domain {\n    org.apache.activemq.artemis.spi.core.security.jaas.GuestLoginModule sufficient\n        debug=true\n       credentialsInvalidate=true\n       org.apache.activemq.jaas.guest.user=\"guest\"\n       org.apache.activemq.jaas.guest.role=\"guests\";\n\n    org.apache.activemq.artemis.spi.core.security.jaas.PropertiesLoginModule requisite\n        debug=true\n        org.apache.activemq.jaas.properties.user=\"artemis-users.properties\"\n        org.apache.activemq.jaas.properties.role=\"artemis-roles.properties\";\n};\nDepending on the user login data, authentication proceeds as follows:\n\nUser logs in with a valid password — the guest login module fails to authenticate the user (because the user has\npresented a password while the credentialsInvalidate option is enabled) and authentication proceeds to the properties\nlogin module. The properties login module successfully authenticates the user and returns.\n\nUser logs in with an invalid password — the guest login module fails to authenticate the user and authentication proceeds\nto the properties login module. The properties login module also fails to authenticate the user. The nett result is\nauthentication failure.\n\nUser logs in with a blank password — the guest login module successfully authenticates the user and returns immediately.\nThe properties login module is not invoked.\n\n\nPropertiesLoginModule\nThe JAAS properties login module provides a simple store of authentication data, where the relevant user data is stored\nin a pair of flat files. This is convenient for demonstrations and testing, but for an enterprise system, the integration\nwith LDAP is preferable. It is implemented by org.apache.activemq.artemis.spi.core.security.jaas.PropertiesLoginModule.\n\norg.apache.activemq.jaas.properties.user - the path to the file which contains user and password properties\n\norg.apache.activemq.jaas.properties.role - the path to the file which contains user and role properties\n\nreload - boolean flag; whether or not to reload the properties files when a modification occurs; default is false\n\ndebug - boolean flag; if true, enable debugging; this is used only for testing or debugging; normally, it\nshould be set to false, or omitted; default is false\n\n\nIn the context of the properties login module, the artemis-users.properties file consists of a list of properties of the\nform, UserName=Password. For example, to define the users system, user, and guest, you could create a file like\nthe following:\nsystem=manager\nuser=password\nguest=password\nPasswords in artemis-users.properties can be hashed. Such passwords should follow the syntax ENC(). Hashed\npasswords can easily be added to artemis-users.properties using the user CLI command, e.g.:\n    ./artemis user add --username guest --password guest --role admin\n\nThis will use the default org.apache.activemq.artemis.utils.DefaultSensitiveStringCodec to perform a \"one-way\" hash of\nthe password and alter both the artemis-users.properties and artemis-roles.properties files with the specified values. \nThe artemis-roles.properties file consists of a list of properties of the form, Role=UserList, where UserList is a\ncomma-separated list of users. For example, to define the roles admins, users, and guests, you could create a file\nlike the following:\nadmins=system\nusers=system,user\nguests=guest\nLDAPLoginModule\nThe LDAP login module enables you to perform authentication and authorization by checking the incoming credentials against\nuser data stored in a central X.500 directory server. For systems that already have an X.500 directory server in place,\nthis means that you can rapidly integrate ActiveMQ Artemis with the existing security database and user accounts can be\nmanaged using the X.500 system. It is implemented by org.apache.activemq.artemis.spi.core.security.jaas.LDAPLoginModule.\n\ninitialContextFactory - must always be set to com.sun.jndi.ldap.LdapCtxFactory\n\nconnectionURL - specify the location of the directory server using an ldap URL, ldap://Host:Port. You can\noptionally qualify this URL, by adding a forward slash, /, followed by the DN of a particular node in the directory\ntree. For example, ldap://ldapserver:10389/ou=system.\n\nauthentication - specifies the authentication method used when binding to the LDAP server. Can take either of\nthe values, simple (username and password), GSSAPI (Kerberos SASL) or none (anonymous).\n\nconnectionUsername - the DN of the user that opens the connection to the directory server. For example,\nuid=admin,ou=system. Directory servers generally require clients to present username/password credentials in order\nto open a connection.\n\nconnectionPassword - the password that matches the DN from connectionUsername. In the directory server,\nin the DIT, the password is normally stored as a userPassword attribute in the corresponding directory entry.\n\nsaslLoginConfigScope - the scope in JAAS configuration (login.config) to use to obtain Kerberos initiator credentials\nwhen the authentication method is SASL GSSAPI. The default value is broker-sasl-gssapi.\n\nconnectionProtocol - currently, the only supported value is a blank string. In future, this option will allow\nyou to select the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) for the connection to the directory server. This option must be set\nexplicitly to an empty string, because it has no default value.\n\nuserBase - selects a particular subtree of the DIT to search for user entries. The subtree is specified by a\nDN, which specifes the base node of the subtree. For example, by setting this option to ou=User,ou=ActiveMQ,ou=system,\nthe search for user entries is restricted to the subtree beneath the ou=User,ou=ActiveMQ,ou=system node.\n\nuserSearchMatching - specifies an LDAP search filter, which is applied to the subtree selected by userBase.\nBefore passing to the LDAP search operation, the string value you provide here is subjected to string substitution,\nas implemented by the java.text.MessageFormat class. Essentially, this means that the special string, {0}, is\nsubstituted by the username, as extracted from the incoming client credentials.\nAfter substitution, the string is interpreted as an LDAP search filter, where the LDAP search filter syntax is\ndefined by the IETF standard, RFC 2254. A short introduction to the search filter syntax is available from Oracle's\nJNDI tutorial, Search Filters.\nFor example, if this option is set to (uid={0}) and the received username is jdoe, the search filter becomes\n(uid=jdoe) after string substitution. If the resulting search filter is applied to the subtree selected by the\nuser base, ou=User,ou=ActiveMQ,ou=system, it would match the entry, uid=jdoe,ou=User,ou=ActiveMQ,ou=system\n(and possibly more deeply nested entries, depending on the specified search depth—see the userSearchSubtree option).\n\nuserSearchSubtree - specify the search depth for user entries, relative to the node specified by userBase.\nThis option is a boolean. false indicates it will try to match one of the child entries of the userBase node\n(maps to javax.naming.directory.SearchControls.ONELEVEL_SCOPE). true indicates it will try to match any entry\nbelonging to the subtree of the userBase node (maps to javax.naming.directory.SearchControls.SUBTREE_SCOPE).\n\nuserRoleName - specifies the name of the multi-valued attribute of the user entry that contains a list of\nrole names for the user (where the role names are interpreted as group names by the broker's authorization plug-in).\nIf you omit this option, no role names are extracted from the user entry.\n\nroleBase - if you want to store role data directly in the directory server, you can use a combination of role\noptions (roleBase, roleSearchMatching, roleSearchSubtree, and roleName) as an alternative to (or in addition\nto) specifying the userRoleName option. This option selects a particular subtree of the DIT to search for role/group\nentries. The subtree is specified by a DN, which specifes the base node of the subtree. For example, by setting this\noption to ou=Group,ou=ActiveMQ,ou=system, the search for role/group entries is restricted to the subtree beneath\nthe ou=Group,ou=ActiveMQ,ou=system node.\n\nroleName - specifies the attribute type of the role entry that contains the name of the role/group (e.g. C, O,\nOU, etc.). If you omit this option the full DN of the role is used.\n\nroleSearchMatching - specifies an LDAP search filter, which is applied to the subtree selected by roleBase.\nThis works in a similar manner to the userSearchMatching option, except that it supports two substitution strings,\nas follows:\n\n{0} - substitutes the full DN of the matched user entry (that is, the result of the user search). For\nexample, for the user, jdoe, the substituted string could be uid=jdoe,ou=User,ou=ActiveMQ,ou=system.\n\n{1} - substitutes the received username. For example, jdoe.\n\n\nFor example, if this option is set to (member=uid={1}) and the received username is jdoe, the search filter\nbecomes (member=uid=jdoe) after string substitution (assuming ApacheDS search filter syntax). If the resulting\nsearch filter is applied to the subtree selected by the role base, ou=Group,ou=ActiveMQ,ou=system, it matches all\nrole entries that have a member attribute equal to uid=jdoe (the value of a member attribute is a DN).\nThis option must always be set to enable role searching because it has no default value. Leaving it unset disables\nrole searching and the role information must come from userRoleName.\nIf you use OpenLDAP, the syntax of the search filter is (member:=uid=jdoe).\n\nroleSearchSubtree - specify the search depth for role entries, relative to the node specified by roleBase.\nThis option can take boolean values, as follows:\n\nfalse (default) - try to match one of the child entries of the roleBase node (maps to\njavax.naming.directory.SearchControls.ONELEVEL_SCOPE).\n\ntrue — try to match any entry belonging to the subtree of the roleBase node (maps to\njavax.naming.directory.SearchControls.SUBTREE_SCOPE).\n\n\n\nauthenticateUser - boolean flag to disable authentication. Useful as an optimisation when this module is used just for\nrole mapping of a Subject's existing authenticated principals; default is false.\n\ndebug - boolean flag; if true, enable debugging; this is used only for testing or debugging; normally, it\nshould be set to false, or omitted; default is false\n\n\nAdd user entries under the node specified by the userBase option. When creating a new user entry in the directory,\nchoose an object class that supports the userPassword attribute (for example, the person or inetOrgPerson object\nclasses are typically suitable). After creating the user entry, add the userPassword attribute, to hold the user's\npassword.\nIf you want to store role data in dedicated role entries (where each node represents a particular role), create a role\nentry as follows. Create a new child of the roleBase node, where the objectClass of the child is groupOfNames. Set\nthe cn (or whatever attribute type is specified by roleName) of the new child node equal to the name of the\nrole/group. Define a member attribute for each member of the role/group, setting the member value to the DN of the\ncorresponding user (where the DN is specified either fully, uid=jdoe,ou=User,ou=ActiveMQ,ou=system, or partially,\nuid=jdoe).\nIf you want to add roles to user entries, you would need to customize the directory schema, by adding a suitable\nattribute type to the user entry's object class. The chosen attribute type must be capable of handling multiple values.\nCertificateLoginModule\nThe JAAS certificate authentication login module must be used in combination with SSL and the clients must be configured\nwith their own certificate. In this scenario, authentication is actually performed during the SSL/TLS handshake, not\ndirectly by the JAAS certificate authentication plug-in. The role of the plug-in is as follows:\n\nTo further constrain the set of acceptable users, because only the user DNs explicitly listed in the relevant\nproperties file are eligible to be authenticated.\n\nTo associate a list of groups with the received user identity, facilitating integration with the authorization feature.\n\nTo require the presence of an incoming certificate (by default, the SSL/TLS layer is configured to treat the\npresence of a client certificate as optional).\n\n\nThe JAAS certificate login module stores a collection of certificate DNs in a pair of flat files. The files associate a\nusername and a list of group IDs with each DN.\nThe certificate login module is implemented by the following class:\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.spi.core.security.jaas.TextFileCertificateLoginModule\nThe following CertLogin login entry shows how to configure certificate login module in the login.config file:\nCertLogin {\n    org.apache.activemq.artemis.spi.core.security.jaas.TextFileCertificateLoginModule\n        debug=true\n        org.apache.activemq.jaas.textfiledn.user=\"users.properties\"\n        org.apache.activemq.jaas.textfiledn.role=\"roles.properties\";\n};\nIn the preceding example, the JAAS realm is configured to use a single org.apache.activemq.artemis.spi.core.security.jaas.TextFileCertificateLoginModule\nlogin module. The options supported by this login module are as follows:\n\ndebug - boolean flag; if true, enable debugging; this is used only for testing or debugging; normally,\nit should be set to false, or omitted; default is false\n\norg.apache.activemq.jaas.textfiledn.user - specifies the location of the user properties file (relative to the\n directory containing the login configuration file).\n\norg.apache.activemq.jaas.textfiledn.role - specifies the location of the role properties file (relative to the\ndirectory containing the login configuration file).\n\nreload - boolean flag; whether or not to reload the properties files when a modification occurs; default is false\n\n\nIn the context of the certificate login module, the users.properties file consists of a list of properties of the form,\nUserName=StringifiedSubjectDN. For example, to define the users, system, user, and guest, you could create a file like\nthe following:\nsystem=CN=system,O=Progress,C=US\nuser=CN=humble user,O=Progress,C=US\nguest=CN=anon,O=Progress,C=DE\nEach username is mapped to a subject DN, encoded as a string (where the string encoding is specified by RFC 2253). For\nexample, the system username is mapped to the CN=system,O=Progress,C=US subject DN. When performing authentication,\nthe plug-in extracts the subject DN from the received certificate, converts it to the standard string format, and\ncompares it with the subject DNs in the users.properties file by testing for string equality. Consequently, you must\nbe careful to ensure that the subject DNs appearing in the users.properties file are an exact match for the subject\nDNs extracted from the user certificates.\nNote: Technically, there is some residual ambiguity in the DN string format. For example, the domainComponent attribute\ncould be represented in a string either as the string, DC, or as the OID, 0.9.2342.19200300.100.1.25. Normally, you do\nnot need to worry about this ambiguity. But it could potentially be a problem, if you changed the underlying\nimplementation of the Java security layer.\nThe easiest way to obtain the subject DNs from the user certificates is by invoking the keytool utility to print the\ncertificate contents. To print the contents of a certificate in a keystore, perform the following steps:\n\nExport the certificate from the keystore file into a temporary file. For example, to export the certificate with\nalias broker-localhost from the broker.ks keystore file, enter the following command:\n   keytool -export -file broker.export -alias broker-localhost -keystore broker.ks -storepass password\nAfter running this command, the exported certificate is in the file, broker.export.\n\nPrint out the contents of the exported certificate. For example, to print out the contents of broker.export,\nenter the following command:\n   keytool -printcert -file broker.export\nWhich should produce output similar to that shown here:\n   Owner: CN=localhost, OU=broker, O=Unknown, L=Unknown, ST=Unknown, C=Unknown\n   Issuer: CN=localhost, OU=broker, O=Unknown, L=Unknown, ST=Unknown, C=Unknown\n   Serial number: 4537c82e\n   Valid from: Thu Oct 19 19:47:10 BST 2006 until: Wed Jan 17 18:47:10 GMT 2007\n   Certificate fingerprints:\n        MD5:  3F:6C:0C:89:A8:80:29:CC:F5:2D:DA:5C:D7:3F:AB:37\n        SHA1: F0:79:0D:04:38:5A:46:CE:86:E1:8A:20:1F:7B:AB:3A:46:E4:34:5C\nThe string following Owner: gives the subject DN. The format used to enter the subject DN depends on your\nplatform. The Owner: string above could be represented as either CN=localhost,\\ OU=broker,\\ O=Unknown,\\ L=Unknown,\\ ST=Unknown,\\ C=Unknown\nor CN=localhost,OU=broker,O=Unknown,L=Unknown,ST=Unknown,C=Unknown.\n\n\nThe roles.properties file consists of a list of properties of the form, Role=UserList, where UserList is a\ncomma-separated list of users. For example, to define the roles admins, users, and guests, you could create a file\nlike the following:\nadmins=system\nusers=system,user\nguests=guest\nThe simplest way to make the login configuration available to JAAS is to add the directory containing the file,\nlogin.config, to your CLASSPATH.\nKerberos Authentication\nYou must have the Kerberos infrastructure set up in your deployment environment before the server can accept Kerberos credentials.\nThe server can acquire its Kerberos acceptor credentials by using JAAS and a Kerberos login module. The JDK provides the\nKrb5LoginModule\nwhich executes the necessary Kerberos protocol steps to authenticate and obtain Kerberos credentials.\nGSSAPI SASL Mechanism\nUsing SASL over AMQP, Kerberos authentication is supported using the GSSAPI SASL mechanism.\nWith SASL doing Kerberos authentication, TLS can be used to provide integrity and confidentially to the communications\nchannel in the normal way.\nThe GSSAPI SASL mechanism must be enabled  on the AMQP acceptor in broker.xml by adding it to the saslMechanisms list url parameter:\nsaslMechanisms=\"GSSAPI.\ntcp://0.0.0.0:5672?protocols=AMQP;saslMechanisms=GSSAPI\nThe GSSAPI mechanism implementation on the server will use a JAAS configuration scope named amqp-sasl-gssapi to\nobtain it's Kerberos acceptor credentials. An alternative configuration scope can be specified on the AMQP acceptor\nusing the url parameter: saslLoginConfigScope=.\nAn example configuration scope for login.config that will pick up a Kerberos keyTab for the Kerberos acceptor Principal\namqp/localhost is as follows:\namqp-sasl-gssapi {\n    com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule required\n    isInitiator=false\n    storeKey=true\n    useKeyTab=true\n    principal=\"amqp/localhost\"\n    debug=true;\n};\nRole Mapping\nOn the server, the Kerberos authenticated Peer Principal can be added to the Subject's principal set as an Apache ActiveMQ Artemis UserPrincipal\nusing the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis Krb5LoginModule login module. The PropertiesLoginModule or\n LDAPLoginModule can then be used to map\nthe authenticated Kerberos Peer Principal to an Apache ActiveMQ Artemis Role. Note\nthat the Kerberos Peer Principal does not exist as an Apache ActiveMQ Artemis user, only as a role member.\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.spi.core.security.jaas.Krb5LoginModule required\n    ;\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.spi.core.security.jaas.LDAPLoginModule optional\n    initialContextFactory=com.sun.jndi.ldap.LdapCtxFactory\n    connectionURL=\"ldap://localhost:1024\"\n    authentication=GSSAPI\n    saslLoginConfigScope=broker-sasl-gssapi\n    connectionProtocol=s\n    userBase=\"ou=users,dc=example,dc=com\"\n    userSearchMatching=\"(krb5PrincipalName={0})\"\n    userSearchSubtree=true\n    authenticateUser=false\n    roleBase=\"ou=system\"\n    roleName=cn\n    roleSearchMatching=\"(member={0})\"\n    roleSearchSubtree=false\n    ;\nTLS Kerberos Cipher Suites\nThe legacy rfc2712 defines TLS Kerberos cipher suites that can be used by TLS to negotiate\nKerberos authentication. The cypher suites offered by rfc2712 are dated and insecure and rfc2712 has been superseded by\nSASL GSSAPI. However, for clients that don't support SASL (core client), using TLS can provide Kerberos authentication\nover an unsecure channel.\nChanging the username/password for clustering\nIn order for cluster connections to work correctly, each node in the\ncluster must make connections to the other nodes. The username/password\nthey use for this should always be changed from the installation default\nto prevent a security risk.\nPlease see Management for instructions on how to do this.\nSecuring the console\nArtemis comes with a web console that allows user to browse Artemis documentation via an embedded server. By default the\nweb access is plain HTTP. It is configured in bootstrap.xml:\n\n    \n\nAlternatively you can edit the above configuration to enable secure access using HTTPS protocol. e.g.:\n\n    \n\nAs shown in the example, to enable https the first thing to do is config the bind to be an https url. In addition,\nYou will have to configure a few extra properties desribed as below.\n\nkeyStorePath - The path of the key store file.\n\nkeyStorePassword - The key store's password.\n\nclientAuth - The boolean flag indicates whether or not client authentication is required. Default is false.\n\ntrustStorePath - The path of the trust store file. This is needed only if clientAuth is true.\n\ntrustStorePassword - The trust store's password.\n\n\nControlling JMS ObjectMessage deserialization\nArtemis provides a simple class filtering mechanism with which a user can specify which\npackages are to be trusted and which are not. Objects whose classes are from trusted packages\ncan be deserialized without problem, whereas those from 'not trusted' packages will be denied\ndeserialization.\nArtemis keeps a black list to keep track of packages that are not trusted and a white list\nfor trusted packages. By default both lists are empty, meaning any serializable object is\nallowed to be deserialized. If an object whose class matches one of the packages in black list,\nit is not allowed to be deserialized. If it matches one in the white list\nthe object can be deserialized. If a package appears in both black list and white list,\nthe one in black list takes precedence. If a class neither matches with black list\nnor with the white list, the class deserialization will be denied\nunless the white list is empty (meaning the user doesn't specify the white list at all).\nA class is considered as a 'match' if\n\nits full name exactly matches one of the entries in the list.\nits package matches one of the entries in the list or is a sub-package of one of the entries.\n\nFor example, if a class full name is \"org.apache.pkg1.Class1\", some matching entries could be:\n\norg.apache.pkg1.Class1 - exact match.\norg.apache.pkg1 - exact package match.\norg.apache -- sub package match.\n\nA * means 'match-all' in a black or white list.\nSpecifying black list and white list via Connection Factories\nTo specify the white and black lists one can use the URL parameters\ndeserializationBlackList and deserializationWhiteList. For example,\nusing JMS:\n ActiveMQConnectionFactory factory = new ActiveMQConnectionFactory(\"vm://0?deserializationBlackList=org.apache.pkg1,org.some.pkg2\");\nThe above statement creates a factory that has a black list contains two\nforbidden packages, \"org.apache.pkg1\" and \"org.some.pkg2\", separated by a\ncomma.\nSpecifying black list and white list via system properties\nThere are two system properties available for specifying black list and white list:\n\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.jms.deserialization.whitelist - comma separated list of entries for the white list.\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.jms.deserialization.blacklist - comma separated list of entries for the black list.\n\nOnce defined, all JMS object message deserialization in the VM is subject to checks against the two lists. However if you create a ConnectionFactory\nand set a new set of black/white lists on it, the new values will override the system properties.\nSpecifying black list and white list for resource adapters\nMessage beans using a JMS resource adapter to receive messages can also control their object deserialization via properly configuring relevant\nproperties for their resource adapters. There are two properties that you can configure with connection factories in a resource adapter:\n\ndeserializationBlackList - comma separated values for black list\ndeserializationWhiteList - comma separated values for white list\n\nThese properties, once specified, are eventually set on the corresponding internal factories.\nSpecifying black list and white list for REST interface\nApache Artemis REST interface (Rest) allows interactions between jms client and rest clients.\nIt uses JMS ObjectMessage to wrap the actual user data between the 2 types of clients and deserialization\nis needed during this process. If you want to control the deserialization for REST, you need to set the\nblack/white lists for it separately as Apache Artemis REST Interface is deployed as a web application.\nYou need to put the black/white lists in its web.xml, as context parameters, as follows\n\n    \n        org.apache.activemq.artemis.jms.deserialization.whitelist\n        some.allowed.class\n    \n    \n        org.apache.activemq.artemis.jms.deserialization.blacklist\n        some.forbidden.class\n    \n...\n\nThe param-value for each list is a comma separated string value representing the list.\nMasking Passwords\nFor details about masking passwords in broker.xml please see the Masking Passwords chapter.\n"},"masking-passwords.html":{"url":"masking-passwords.html","title":"Masking Passwords","keywords":"","body":"Masking Passwords\nBy default all passwords in Apache ActiveMQ Artemis server's configuration files are in\nplain text form. This usually poses no security issues as those files\nshould be well protected from unauthorized accessing. However, in some\ncircumstances a user doesn't want to expose its passwords to more eyes\nthan necessary.\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis can be configured to use 'masked' passwords in its\nconfiguration files. A masked password is an obscure string\nrepresentation of a real password. To mask a password a user will use an\n'encoder'. The encoder takes in the real password and outputs the masked\nversion. A user can then replace the real password in the configuration\nfiles with the new masked password. When Apache ActiveMQ Artemis loads a masked\npassword, it uses a suitable 'decoder' to decode it into real password.\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis provides a default password encoder and decoder. Optionally\nusers can use or implement their own encoder and decoder for masking the\npasswords.\nPassword Masking in Server Configuration File\nGeneral Masking Configuration\nThe server configuration file (i.e. broker.xml )has a property that defines the\ndefault masking behaviors over the entire file scope.\nmask-password: this boolean type property indicates if a password\nshould be masked or not. Set it to \"true\" if you want your passwords\nmasked. The default value is \"false\".\npassword-codec: this string type property identifies the name of the class\nwhich will be used to decode the masked password within the broker. If not\nspecified then the default org.apache.activemq.artemis.utils.DefaultSensitiveStringCodec\nwill be used.\nSpecific Masking Behaviors\ncluster-password\nIf mask-password is true the cluster-password will be treated as masked.\nPasswords in connectors and acceptors\nIn broker.xml connector and acceptor configurations sometimes needs to\nspecify passwords. For example, if a user wants to use an acceptor with\nsslEnabled=true it can specify keyStorePassword and trustStorePassword.\nBecause Acceptors and Connectors are pluggable implementations, each transport\nwill have different password masking needs.\nWhen a connector or acceptor is initialised, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis will\nadd the aforementioned mask-password and password-codec values to the\nconnector or acceptor parameters using the keys activemq.usemaskedpassword\nand activemq.passwordcodec respectively. The Netty and InVM implementations\nwill use these as needed and any other implementations will have access to\nthese to use if they so wish.\nPasswords in bridge configurations\nCore Bridges are configured in the server configuration file and so the\nmasking of its password properties follows the same rules as that of\ncluster-password.\nExamples\nThe following table summarizes the relations among the above-mentioned\nproperties\n\n\n\nmask-password\ncluster-password\nacceptor/connector passwords\nbridge password\n\n\n\n\n  absent\nplain text\nplain text\nplain text\n\n\n  false\nplain text\nplain text\nplain text\n\n\n  true\nmasked\nmasked\nmasked\n\n\n\nExamples\nNote: In the following examples if related attributed or properties are\nabsent, it means they are not specified in the configure file.\nexample 1\nbbc\n\nThis indicates the cluster password is a plain text value (\"bbc\").\nexample 2\ntrue\n80cf731af62c290\n\nThis indicates the cluster password is a masked value and Apache ActiveMQ Artemis will\nuse its built-in decoder to decode it. All other passwords in the\nconfiguration file, Connectors, Acceptors and Bridges, will also use\nmasked passwords.\nMasking passwords in ActiveMQ Artemis JCA ResourceAdapter and MDB activation configurations\nBoth ra.xml and MDB activation configuration have a password property\nthat can be masked. They are controlled by the following two optional\nResource Adapter properties in ra.xml:\nUseMaskedPassword -- If setting to \"true\" the passwords are masked.\nDefault is false.\nPasswordCodec -- Class name and its parameters for the Decoder used to\ndecode the masked password. Ignored if UseMaskedPassword is false. The\nformat of this property is a full qualified class name optionally\nfollowed by key/value pairs. It is the same format as that for JMS\nBridges. Example:\n\n  UseMaskedPassword\n  boolean\n  true\n\n\n  PasswordCodec\n  java.lang.String\n  com.foo.ADecoder;key=helloworld\n\n\nWith this configuration, both passwords in ra.xml and all of its MDBs\nwill have to be in masked form.\nMasking passwords in artemis-users.properties\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis's built-in security manager uses plain properties files\nwhere the user passwords are specified in a hashed form by default. Note, the passwords\nare technically hashed rather than masked in this context. The default PropertiesLoginModule\nwill not decode the passwords in artemis-users.properties but will instead hash the input\nand compare the two hashed values for password verification.\nPlease use Artemis CLI command to add a password. For example:\n    ./artemis user add --username guest --password guest --role admin\n\nThis will use the default org.apache.activemq.artemis.utils.DefaultSensitiveStringCodec\nto perform a \"one-way\" hash of the password and alter both the artemis-users.properties\nand artemis-roles.properties files with the specified values.\nPasswords in artemis-users.properties are automatically detected as hashed or not\nby looking for the syntax ENC(). The mask-password parameter does not need\nto be true to use hashed passwords here.\nChoosing a decoder for password masking\nAs described in the previous sections, all password masking requires a\ndecoder. A decoder uses an algorithm to convert a masked password into\nits original clear text form in order to be used in various security\noperations. The algorithm used for decoding must match that for\nencoding. Otherwise the decoding may not be successful.\nFor user's convenience Apache ActiveMQ Artemis provides a default decoder.\nHowever a user can implement their own if they wish.\nThe Default Decoder\nWhenever no decoder is specified in the configuration file, the default\ndecoder is used. The class name for the default decoder is\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.utils.DefaultSensitiveStringCodec. It has hashing,\nencoding, and decoding capabilities. It uses java.crypto.Cipher utilities\nto hash or encode a plaintext password and also to decode a masked string using\nsame algorithm and key. Using this decoder/encoder is pretty straightforward. To\nget a mask for a password, just run the mask command:\n./artemis mask \n\nYou'll get something like\nresult: 32c6f67dae6cd61b0a7ad1702033aa81e6b2a760123f4360\nJust copy 32c6f67dae6cd61b0a7ad1702033aa81e6b2a760123f4360 and replace your\nplaintext password in broker.xml with it.\nUsing a custom decoder\nIt is possible to use a custom decoder rather than the built-in one.\nSimply make sure the decoder is in Apache ActiveMQ Artemis's classpath. The custom decoder\ncan also be service loaded rather than class loaded, if the decoder's service provider is installed in the classpath.\nThen configure the server to use it as follows:\n    com.foo.SomeDecoder;key1=value1;key2=value2\n\nIf your decoder needs params passed to it you can do this via key/value\npairs when configuring. For instance if your decoder needs say a\n\"key-location\" parameter, you can define like so:\n    com.foo.NewDecoder;key-location=/some/url/to/keyfile\n\nThen configure your cluster-password like this:\n    true\n    masked_password\n\nWhen Apache ActiveMQ Artemis reads the cluster-password it will initialize the\nNewDecoder and use it to decode \"mask_password\". It also process all\npasswords using the new defined decoder.\nImplementing your own codecs\nTo use a different decoder than the built-in one, you either pick one\nfrom existing libraries or you implement it yourself. All decoders must\nimplement the org.apache.activemq.artemis.utils.SensitiveDataCodec\ninterface:\npublic interface SensitiveDataCodec\n{\n   T decode(Object mask) throws Exception;\n\n   void init(Map params);\n}\n\nThis is a generic type interface but normally for a password you just\nneed String type. So a new decoder would be defined like\npublic class MyNewDecoder implements SensitiveDataCodec\n{\n   public String decode(Object mask) throws Exception\n   {\n      //decode the mask into clear text password\n      return \"the password\";\n   }\n\n   public void init(Map params)\n   {\n      //initialization done here. It is called right after the decoder has been created.\n   }\n}\n\nLast but not least, once you get your own decoder, please add it to the\nclasspath by packaging it in a JAR file and putting the JAR file in the lib\ndirectory. Otherwise Apache ActiveMQ Artemis will fail to load it!\n"},"broker-plugins.html":{"url":"broker-plugins.html","title":"Broker Plugins","keywords":"","body":"Apache ActiveMQ Artemis Plugin Support\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis is designed to allow extra functionality to be added by\ncreating a plugin.

The source and the\ntarget can be located in the same virtual machine or another one.\nThe bridge can also be used to bridge messages from other non Apache ActiveMQ Artemis\nJMS servers, as long as they are JMS 1.1 compliant.\n\nNote\nDo not confuse a JMS bridge with a core bridge. A JMS bridge can be\nused to bridge any two JMS 1.1 compliant JMS providers and uses the\nJMS API. A core bridge (described in Core Bridges) is used to bridge any two\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis instances and uses the core API. Always use a core bridge if\nyou can in preference to a JMS bridge. The core bridge will typically\nprovide better performance than a JMS bridge. Also the core bridge can\nprovide once and only once delivery guarantees without using XA.\n\nThe bridge has built-in resilience to failure so if the source or target\nserver connection is lost, e.g. due to network failure, the bridge will\nretry connecting to the source and/or target until they come back\nonline. When it comes back online it will resume operation as normal.\nThe bridge can be configured with an optional JMS selector, so it will\nonly consume messages matching that JMS selector\nIt can be configured to consume from a queue or a topic. When it\nconsumes from a topic it can be configured to consume using a non\ndurable or durable subscription\nTypically, the bridge is deployed by the JBoss Micro Container via a\nbeans configuration file. This would typically be deployed inside the\nJBoss Application Server and the following example shows an example of a\nbeans file that bridges 2 destinations which are actually on the same\nserver.\nThe JMS Bridge is a simple POJO so can be deployed with most frameworks,\nsimply instantiate the org.apache.activemq.artemis.api.jms.bridge.impl.JMSBridgeImpl\nclass and set the appropriate parameters.\nJMS Bridge Parameters\nThe main bean deployed is the JMSBridge bean.

Apache ActiveMQ Artemis doesn't ship with such an implementation, but\nif you are running within an Application Server you can inject the Transaction\nManager that is shipped.\nSource and Target Connection Factories\nThe source and target connection factory factories are used to create\nthe connection factory used to create the connection for the source or\ntarget server.\nThe configuration example above uses the default implementation provided\nby Apache ActiveMQ Artemis that looks up the connection factory using JNDI. For other\nApplication Servers or JMS providers a new implementation may have to be\nprovided. This can easily be done by implementing the interface\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.jms.bridge.ConnectionFactoryFactory.\nSource and Target Destination Factories\nAgain, similarly, these are used to create or lookup up the\ndestinations.\nIn the configuration example above, we have used the default provided by\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis that looks up the destination using JNDI.\nA new implementation can be provided by implementing\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.jms.bridge.DestinationFactory interface.\nQuality Of Service\nThe quality of service modes used by the bridge are described here in\nmore detail.\nAT_MOST_ONCE\nWith this QoS mode messages will reach the destination from the source\nat most once. The messages are consumed from the source and acknowledged\nbefore sending to the destination. Therefore there is a possibility that\nif failure occurs between removing them from the source and them\narriving at the destination they could be lost. Hence delivery will\noccur at most once.\nThis mode is available for both durable and non-durable messages.\nDUPLICATES_OK\nWith this QoS mode, the messages are consumed from the source and then\nacknowledged after they have been successfully sent to the destination.\nTherefore there is a possibility that if failure occurs after sending to\nthe destination but before acknowledging them, they could be sent again\nwhen the system recovers. I.e. the destination might receive duplicates\nafter a failure.\nThis mode is available for both durable and non-durable messages.\nONCE_AND_ONLY_ONCE\nThis QoS mode ensures messages will reach the destination from the\nsource once and only once. (Sometimes this mode is known as \"exactly\nonce\"). If both the source and the destination are on the same Apache ActiveMQ Artemis\nserver instance then this can be achieved by sending and acknowledging\nthe messages in the same local transaction. If the source and\ndestination are on different servers this is achieved by enlisting the\nsending and consuming sessions in a JTA transaction. The JTA transaction\nis controlled by a JTA Transaction Manager which will need to be set\nvia the settransactionManager method on the Bridge.\nThis mode is only available for durable messages.\n\nNote\nFor a specific application it may possible to provide once and only\nonce semantics without using the ONCE_AND_ONLY_ONCE QoS level. This\ncan be done by using the DUPLICATES_OK mode and then checking for\nduplicates at the destination and discarding them. Some JMS servers\nprovide automatic duplicate message detection functionality, or this\nmay be possible to implement on the application level by maintaining a\ncache of received message ids on disk and comparing received messages\nto them. The cache would only be valid for a certain period of time so\nthis approach is not as watertight as using ONCE_AND_ONLY_ONCE but\nmay be a good choice depending on your specific application.\n\nTime outs and the JMS bridge\nThere is a possibility that the target or source server will not be\navailable at some point in time. If this occurs then the bridge will try\nMax Retries to reconnect every Failure Retry Interval milliseconds\nas specified in the JMS Bridge definition.\nHowever since a third party JNDI is used, in this case the JBoss naming\nserver, it is possible for the JNDI lookup to hang if the network were\nto disappear during the JNDI lookup. To stop this from occurring the\nJNDI definition can be configured to time out if this occurs. To do this\nset the jnp.timeout and the jnp.sotimeout on the Initial Context\ndefinition. The first sets the connection timeout for the initial\nconnection and the second the read timeout for the socket.\n\nNote\nOnce the initial JNDI connection has succeeded all calls are made\nusing RMI. If you want to control the timeouts for the RMI connections\nthen this can be done via system properties. JBoss uses Sun's RMI and\nthe properties can be found\nhere.\nThe default connection timeout is 10 seconds and the default read\ntimeout is 18 seconds.\n\nIf you implement your own factories for looking up JMS resources then\nyou will have to bear in mind timeout issues.\nExamples\nPlease see the examples chapter which shows how to configure and use a JMS Bridge with\nJBoss AS to send messages to the source destination and consume them\nfrom the target destination and how to configure and use a JMS Bridge between\ntwo standalone Apache ActiveMQ Artemis servers.\n"},"client-reconnection.html":{"url":"client-reconnection.html","title":"Client Reconnection and Session Reattachment","keywords":"","body":"Client Reconnection and Session Reattachment\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis clients can be configured to automatically reconnect or\nre-attach to the server in the event that a failure is detected in the\nconnection between the client and the server.\n100% Transparent session re-attachment\nIf the failure was due to some transient failure such as a temporary\nnetwork failure, and the target server was not restarted, then the\nsessions will still be existent on the server, assuming the client\nhasn't been disconnected for more than connection-ttl Detecting Dead Connections\nIn this scenario, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis will automatically re-attach the client\nsessions to the server sessions when the connection reconnects. This is\ndone 100% transparently and the client can continue exactly as if\nnothing had happened.\nThe way this works is as follows:\nAs Apache ActiveMQ Artemis clients send commands to their servers they store each sent\ncommand in an in-memory buffer. In the case that connection failure\noccurs and the client subsequently reattaches to the same server, as\npart of the reattachment protocol the server informs the client during\nreattachment with the id of the last command it successfully received\nfrom that client.\nIf the client has sent more commands than were received before failover\nit can replay any sent commands from its buffer so that the client and\nserver can reconcile their states.Ac\nThe size of this buffer is configured with the confirmationWindowSize\nparameter on the connection URL. When the server has received\nconfirmationWindowSize bytes of commands and processed them it will\nsend back a command confirmation to the client, and the client can then\nfree up space in the buffer.\nThe window is specified in bytes.\nSetting this parameter to -1 disables any buffering and prevents any\nre-attachment from occurring, forcing reconnect instead. The default\nvalue for this parameter is -1. (Which means by default no auto\nre-attachment will occur)\nSession reconnection\nAlternatively, the server might have actually been restarted after\ncrashing or being stopped. In this case any sessions will no longer be\nexistent on the server and it won't be possible to 100% transparently\nre-attach to them.\nIn this case, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis will automatically reconnect the connection and\nrecreate any sessions and consumers on the server corresponding to the\nsessions and consumers on the client. This process is exactly the same\nas what happens during failover onto a backup server.\nClient reconnection is also used internally by components such as core\nbridges to allow them to reconnect to their target servers.\nPlease see the section on failover Automatic Client Failover to get a full understanding of how\ntransacted and non-transacted sessions are reconnected during\nfailover/reconnect and what you need to do to maintain once and only\noncedelivery guarantees.\nConfiguring reconnection/reattachment attributes\nClient reconnection is configured using the following parameters:\n\nretryInterval. This optional parameter determines the period in\nmilliseconds between subsequent reconnection attempts, if the\nconnection to the target server has failed. The default value is\n2000 milliseconds.\n\nretryIntervalMultiplier. This optional parameter determines\ndetermines a multiplier to apply to the time since the last retry to\ncompute the time to the next retry.\nThis allows you to implement an exponential backoff between retry\nattempts.\nLet's take an example:\nIf we set retryInterval to 1000 ms and we set\nretryIntervalMultiplier to 2.0, then, if the first reconnect\nattempt fails, we will wait 1000 ms then 2000 ms then 4000 ms\nbetween subsequent reconnection attempts.\nThe default value is 1.0 meaning each reconnect attempt is spaced\nat equal intervals.\n\nmaxRetryInterval. This optional parameter determines the maximum\nretry interval that will be used. When setting\nretryIntervalMultiplier it would otherwise be possible that\nsubsequent retries exponentially increase to ridiculously large\nvalues. By setting this parameter you can set an upper limit on that\nvalue. The default value is 2000 milliseconds.\n\nreconnectAttempts. This optional parameter determines the total\nnumber of reconnect attempts to make before giving up and shutting\ndown. A value of -1 signifies an unlimited number of attempts. The\ndefault value is 0.\n\n\nAll of these parameters are set on the URL used to connect to the broker.\nIf your client does manage to reconnect but the session is no longer\navailable on the server, for instance if the server has been restarted\nor it has timed out, then the client won't be able to re-attach, and any\nExceptionListener or FailureListener instances registered on the\nconnection or session will be called.\nExceptionListeners and SessionFailureListeners\nPlease note, that when a client reconnects or re-attaches, any\nregistered JMS ExceptionListener or core API SessionFailureListener\nwill be called.\n"},"diverts.html":{"url":"diverts.html","title":"Diverting and Splitting Message Flows","keywords":"","body":"Diverting and Splitting Message Flows\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis allows you to configure objects called diverts with some\nsimple server configuration.\nDiverts allow you to transparently divert messages routed to one address\nto some other address, without making any changes to any client\napplication logic.\nDiverts can be exclusive, meaning that the message is diverted to the\nnew address, and does not go to the old address at all, or they can be\nnon-exclusive which means the message continues to go the old address,\nand a copy of it is also sent to the new address. Non-exclusive\ndiverts can therefore be used for splitting message flows, e.g. there\nmay be a requirement to monitor every order sent to an order queue.\nDiverts can also be configured to have an optional message filter. If\nspecified then only messages that match the filter will be diverted.\nWhen an address has both exclusive and non-exclusive diverts configured,\nthe exclusive ones are processed first. If any of the exclusive diverts\ndiverted the message, the non-exclusive ones are not processed.\nDiverts can also be configured to apply a Transformer. If specified,\nall diverted messages will have the opportunity of being transformed by\nthe Transformer. When an address has multiple diverts configured, all\nof them receive the same, original message. This means that the results\nof a transformer on a message are not directly available for other\ndiverts or their filters on the same address.\nA divert will only divert a message to an address on the same server,\nhowever, if you want to divert to an address on a different server, a\ncommon pattern would be to divert to a local store-and-forward queue,\nthen set up a bridge which consumes from that queue and forwards to an\naddress on a different server.\nDiverts are therefore a very sophisticated concept, which when combined\nwith bridges can be used to create interesting and complex routings. The\nset of diverts on a server can be thought of as a type of routing table\nfor messages. Combining diverts with bridges allows you to create a\ndistributed network of reliable routing connections between multiple\ngeographically distributed servers, creating your global messaging mesh.\nDiverts are defined as xml in the broker.xml file at the core attribute level.\nThere can be zero or more diverts in the file.\nPlease see the examples for a full working example showing you how to\nconfigure and use diverts.\nLet's take a look at some divert examples:\nExclusive Divert\nLet's take a look at an exclusive divert. An exclusive divert diverts\nall matching messages that are routed to the old address to the new\naddress. Matching messages do not get routed to the old address.\nHere's some example xml configuration for an exclusive divert, it's\ntaken from the divert example:\n\n   priceUpdates\n   priceForwarding\n   \n   \n      org.apache.activemq.artemis.jms.example.AddForwardingTimeTransformer\n   \n   true\n\nWe define a divert called prices-divert that will divert any\nmessages sent to the address priceUpdates to another local address \npriceForwarding.\nWe also specify a message filter string so only messages with the\nmessage property office with value New York will get diverted, all\nother messages will continue to be routed to the normal address. The\nfilter string is optional, if not specified then all messages will be\nconsidered matched.\nIn this example a transformer class is specified. Again this is\noptional, and if specified the transformer will be executed for each\nmatching message. This allows you to change the messages body or\nproperties before it is diverted. In this example the transformer simply\nadds a header that records the time the divert happened.\nThis example is actually diverting messages to a local store and forward\nqueue, which is configured with a bridge which forwards the message to\nan address on another ActiveMQ Artemis server. Please see the example for more\ndetails.\nNon-exclusive Divert\nNow we'll take a look at a non-exclusive divert. Non exclusive diverts\nare the same as exclusive diverts, but they only forward a copy of the\nmessage to the new address. The original message continues to the old\naddress\nYou can therefore think of non-exclusive diverts as splitting a\nmessage flow.\nNon exclusive diverts can be configured in the same way as exclusive\ndiverts with an optional filter and transformer, here's an example\nnon-exclusive divert, again from the divert example:\n\n    orders\n    spyTopic\n    false\n\nThe above divert example takes a copy of every message sent to the\naddress 'orders' and sends it to a local address called\n'spyTopic'.\n"},"core-bridges.html":{"url":"core-bridges.html","title":"Core Bridges","keywords":"","body":"Core Bridges\nThe function of a bridge is to consume messages from a source queue, and\nforward them to a target address, typically on a different Apache ActiveMQ Artemis\nserver.\nThe source and target servers do not have to be in the same cluster\nwhich makes bridging suitable for reliably sending messages from one\ncluster to another, for instance across a WAN, or internet and where the\nconnection may be unreliable.\nThe bridge has built in resilience to failure so if the target server\nconnection is lost, e.g. due to network failure, the bridge will retry\nconnecting to the target until it comes back online. When it comes back\nonline it will resume operation as normal.\nIn summary, bridges are a way to reliably connect two separate Apache ActiveMQ Artemis\nservers together. With a core bridge both source and target servers must\nbe Apache ActiveMQ Artemis servers.\nBridges can be configured to provide once and only once delivery\nguarantees even in the event of the failure of the source or the target\nserver. They do this by using duplicate detection (described in Duplicate Detection).\n\nNote\nAlthough they have similar function, don't confuse core bridges with\nJMS bridges!\nCore bridges are for linking an Apache ActiveMQ Artemis node with another Apache ActiveMQ Artemis\nnode and do not use the JMS API. A JMS Bridge is used for linking any\ntwo JMS 1.1 compliant JMS providers. So, a JMS Bridge could be used\nfor bridging to or from different JMS compliant messaging system. It's\nalways preferable to use a core bridge if you can. Core bridges use\nduplicate detection to provide once and only once guarantees. To\nprovide the same guarantee using a JMS bridge you would have to use XA\nwhich has a higher overhead and is more complex to configure.\n\nConfiguring Bridges\nBridges are configured in broker.xml. Let's kick off\nwith an example (this is actually from the bridge example):\n\n   sausage-factory\n   mincing-machine\n   \n   \n      org.apache.activemq.artemis.jms.example.HatColourChangeTransformer\n   \n   1000\n   true\n   1.0\n   -1\n   -1\n   false\n   true\n   10000000\n   foouser\n   foopassword\n   \n      remote-connector\n   \n   \n   -->\n\nIn the above example we have shown all the parameters its possible to\nconfigure for a bridge. In practice you might use many of the defaults\nso it won't be necessary to specify them all explicitly.\nLet's take a look at all the parameters in turn:\n\nname attribute. All bridges must have a unique name in the server.\n\nqueue-name. This is the unique name of the local queue that the\nbridge consumes from, it's a mandatory parameter.\nThe queue must already exist by the time the bridge is instantiated\nat start-up.\n\nforwarding-address. This is the address on the target server that\nthe message will be forwarded to. If a forwarding address is not\nspecified, then the original address of the message will be\nretained.\n\nfilter-string. An optional filter string can be supplied. If\nspecified then only messages which match the filter expression\nspecified in the filter string will be forwarded. The filter string\nfollows the ActiveMQ Artemis filter expression syntax described in Filter Expressions.\n\ntransformer-class-name. An optional transformer-class-name can be\nspecified. This is the name of a user-defined class which implements\nthe org.apache.activemq.artemis.core.server.transformer.Transformer interface.\nIf this is specified then the transformer's transform() method\nwill be invoked with the message before it is forwarded. This gives\nyou the opportunity to transform the message's header or body before\nforwarding it.\n\nha. This optional parameter determines whether or not this bridge\nshould support high availability. True means it will connect to any\navailable server in a cluster and support failover. The default\nvalue is false.\n\nretry-interval. This optional parameter determines the period in\nmilliseconds between subsequent reconnection attempts, if the\nconnection to the target server has failed. The default value is\n2000milliseconds.\n\nretry-interval-multiplier. This optional parameter determines\ndetermines a multiplier to apply to the time since the last retry to\ncompute the time to the next retry.\nThis allows you to implement an exponential backoff between retry\nattempts.\nLet's take an example:\nIf we set retry-intervalto 1000 ms and we set\nretry-interval-multiplier to 2.0, then, if the first reconnect\nattempt fails, we will wait 1000 ms then 2000 ms then 4000 ms\nbetween subsequent reconnection attempts.\nThe default value is 1.0 meaning each reconnect attempt is spaced\nat equal intervals.\n\ninitial-connect-attempts. This optional parameter determines the\ntotal number of initial connect attempts the bridge will make before\ngiving up and shutting down. A value of -1 signifies an unlimited\nnumber of attempts. The default value is -1.\n\nreconnect-attempts. This optional parameter determines the total\nnumber of reconnect attempts the bridge will make before giving up\nand shutting down. A value of -1 signifies an unlimited number of\nattempts. The default value is -1.\n\nfailover-on-server-shutdown. This optional parameter determines\nwhether the bridge will attempt to failover onto a backup server (if\nspecified) when the target server is cleanly shutdown rather than\ncrashed.\nThe bridge connector can specify both a live and a backup server, if\nit specifies a backup server and this parameter is set to true\nthen if the target server is cleanly shutdown the bridge\nconnection will attempt to failover onto its backup. If the bridge\nconnector has no backup server configured then this parameter has no\neffect.\nSometimes you want a bridge configured with a live and a backup\ntarget server, but you don't want to failover to the backup if the\nlive server is simply taken down temporarily for maintenance, this\nis when this parameter comes in handy.\nThe default value for this parameter is false.\n\nuse-duplicate-detection. This optional parameter determines\nwhether the bridge will automatically insert a duplicate id property\ninto each message that it forwards.\nDoing so, allows the target server to perform duplicate detection on\nmessages it receives from the source server. If the connection fails\nor server crashes, then, when the bridge resumes it will resend\nunacknowledged messages. This might result in duplicate messages\nbeing sent to the target server. By enabling duplicate detection\nallows these duplicates to be screened out and ignored.\nThis allows the bridge to provide a once and only once delivery\nguarantee without using heavyweight methods such as XA (see Duplicate Detection for\nmore information).\nThe default value for this parameter is true.\n\nconfirmation-window-size. This optional parameter determines the\nconfirmation-window-size to use for the connection used to forward\nmessages to the target node. This attribute is described in section\nReconnection and Session Reattachment\n\nWarning\nWhen using the bridge to forward messages to an address which uses\nthe BLOCK address-full-policy from a queue which has a\nmax-size-bytes set it's important that\nconfirmation-window-size is less than or equal to\nmax-size-bytes to prevent the flow of messages from ceasing.\n\n\nproducer-window-size. This optional parameter determines the\nproducer flow control through the bridge. You usually leave this off\nunless you are dealing with huge large messages. \nDefault=-1 (disabled)\n\nuser. This optional parameter determines the user name to use when\ncreating the bridge connection to the remote server. If it is not\nspecified the default cluster user specified by cluster-user in\nbroker.xml will be used.\n\npassword. This optional parameter determines the password to use\nwhen creating the bridge connection to the remote server. If it is\nnot specified the default cluster password specified by\ncluster-password in broker.xml will be used.\n\nstatic-connectors or discovery-group-ref. Pick either of these\noptions to connect the bridge to the target server.\nThe static-connectors is a list of connector-ref elements\npointing to connector elements defined elsewhere. A connector\nencapsulates knowledge of what transport to use (TCP, SSL, HTTP etc)\nas well as the server connection parameters (host, port etc).

This chapter\nwill explain what duplicate detection is, how Apache ActiveMQ Artemis uses it and how\nand where to configure it.\nWhen sending messages from a client to a server, or indeed from a server\nto another server, if the target server or connection fails sometime\nafter sending the message, but before the sender receives a response\nthat the send (or commit) was processed successfully then the sender\ncannot know for sure if the message was sent successfully to the\naddress.\nIf the target server or connection failed after the send was received\nand processed but before the response was sent back then the message\nwill have been sent to the address successfully, but if the target\nserver or connection failed before the send was received and finished\nprocessing then it will not have been sent to the address successfully.\nFrom the senders point of view it's not possible to distinguish these\ntwo cases.\nWhen the server recovers this leaves the client in a difficult\nsituation. It knows the target server failed, but it does not know if\nthe last message reached its destination ok. If it decides to resend the\nlast message, then that could result in a duplicate message being sent\nto the address. If each message was an order or a trade then this could\nresult in the order being fulfilled twice or the trade being double\nbooked. This is clearly not a desirable situation.\nSending the message(s) in a transaction does not help out either. If the\nserver or connection fails while the transaction commit is being\nprocessed it is also indeterminate whether the transaction was\nsuccessfully committed or not!\nTo solve these issues Apache ActiveMQ Artemis provides automatic duplicate messages\ndetection for messages sent to addresses.\nUsing Duplicate Detection for Message Sending\nEnabling duplicate message detection for sent messages is simple: you\njust need to set a special property on the message to a unique value.\nYou can create the value however you like, as long as it is unique. When\nthe target server receives the message it will check if that property is\nset, if it is, then it will check in its in memory cache if it has\nalready received a message with that value of the header. If it has\nreceived a message with the same value before then it will ignore the\nmessage.\n\nNote\nUsing duplicate detection to move messages between nodes can give you\nthe same once and only once delivery guarantees as if you were using\nan XA transaction to consume messages from source and send them to the\ntarget, but with less overhead and much easier configuration than\nusing XA.\n\nIf you're sending messages in a transaction then you don't have to set\nthe property for every message you send in that transaction, you only\nneed to set it once in the transaction. If the server detects a\nduplicate message for any message in the transaction, then it will\nignore the entire transaction.\nThe name of the property that you set is given by the value of\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.api.core.Message.HDR_DUPLICATE_DETECTION_ID, which\nis _AMQ_DUPL_ID\nThe value of the property can be of type byte[] or SimpleString if\nyou're using the core API. If you're using JMS it must be a String,\nand its value should be unique. An easy way of generating a unique id is\nby generating a UUID.\nHere's an example of setting the property using the core API:\n...\n\nClientMessage message = session.createMessage(true);\n\nSimpleString myUniqueID = \"This is my unique id\";   // Could use a UUID for this\n\nmessage.setStringProperty(HDR_DUPLICATE_DETECTION_ID, myUniqueID);\n\nAnd here's an example using the JMS API:\n...\n\nMessage jmsMessage = session.createMessage();\n\nString myUniqueID = \"This is my unique id\";   // Could use a UUID for this\n\nmessage.setStringProperty(HDR_DUPLICATE_DETECTION_ID.toString(), myUniqueID);\n\n...\n\nConfiguring the Duplicate ID Cache\nThe server maintains caches of received values of the\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.core.message.impl.HDR_DUPLICATE_DETECTION_ID\nproperty sent to each address. Each address has its own distinct cache.\nThe cache is a circular fixed size cache. If the cache has a maximum\nsize of n elements, then the n + 1th id stored will overwrite the\n0th element in the cache.\nThe maximum size of the cache is configured by the parameter\nid-cache-size in broker.xml, the default value is\n2000 elements.\nThe caches can also be configured to persist to disk or not. This is\nconfigured by the parameter persist-id-cache, also in\nbroker.xml. If this is set to true then each id will\nbe persisted to permanent storage as they are received. The default\nvalue for this parameter is true.\n\nNote\nWhen choosing a size of the duplicate id cache be sure to set it to a\nlarger enough size so if you resend messages all the previously sent\nones are in the cache not having been overwritten.\n\nDuplicate Detection and Bridges\nCore bridges can be configured to automatically add a unique duplicate\nid value (if there isn't already one in the message) before forwarding\nthe message to it's target. This ensures that if the target server\ncrashes or the connection is interrupted and the bridge resends the\nmessage, then if it has already been received by the target server, it\nwill be ignored.\nTo configure a core bridge to add the duplicate id header, simply set\nthe use-duplicate-detection to true when configuring a bridge in\nbroker.xml.\nThe default value for this parameter is true.\nFor more information on core bridges and how to configure them, please\nsee Core Bridges.\nDuplicate Detection and Cluster Connections\nCluster connections internally use core bridges to move messages\nreliable between nodes of the cluster. Consequently they can also be\nconfigured to insert the duplicate id header for each message they move\nusing their internal bridges.\nTo configure a cluster connection to add the duplicate id header, simply\nset the use-duplicate-detection to true when configuring a cluster\nconnection in broker.xml.\nThe default value for this parameter is true.\nFor more information on cluster connections and how to configure them,\nplease see Clusters.\n"},"clusters.html":{"url":"clusters.html","title":"Clusters","keywords":"","body":"Clusters\nClusters Overview\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis clusters allow groups of Apache ActiveMQ Artemis servers to be grouped\ntogether in order to share message processing load. Each active node in\nthe cluster is an active Apache ActiveMQ Artemis server which manages its own messages\nand handles its own connections.\nThe cluster is formed by each node declaring cluster connections to\nother nodes in the core configuration file broker.xml.\nWhen a node forms a cluster connection to another node, internally it\ncreates a core bridge (as described in Core Bridges) connection between it and\nthe other node, this is done transparently behind the scenes - you don't\nhave to declare an explicit bridge for each node. These cluster\nconnections allow messages to flow between the nodes of the cluster to\nbalance load.\nNodes can be connected together to form a cluster in many different\ntopologies, we will discuss a couple of the more common topologies later\nin this chapter.\nWe'll also discuss client side load balancing, where we can balance\nclient connections across the nodes of the cluster, and we'll consider\nmessage redistribution where Apache ActiveMQ Artemis will redistribute messages between\nnodes to avoid starvation.\nAnother important part of clustering is server discovery where servers\ncan broadcast their connection details so clients or other servers can\nconnect to them with the minimum of configuration.\n\nWarning\nOnce a cluster node has been configured it is common to simply copy\nthat configuration to other nodes to produce a symmetric cluster.\nHowever, care must be taken when copying the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis files. Do not\ncopy the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis data (i.e. the bindings, journal, and\nlarge-messages directories) from one node to another. When a node is\nstarted for the first time and initializes its journal files it also\npersists a special identifier to the journal directory. This id\nmust be unique among nodes in the cluster or the cluster will not\nform properly.\n\nServer discovery\nServer discovery is a mechanism by which servers can propagate their\nconnection details to:\n\nMessaging clients. A messaging client wants to be able to connect to\nthe servers of the cluster without having specific knowledge of\nwhich servers in the cluster are up at any one time.\n\nOther servers. Servers in a cluster want to be able to create\ncluster connections to each other without having prior knowledge of\nall the other servers in the cluster.\n\n\nThis information, let's call it the Cluster Topology, is actually sent\naround normal Apache ActiveMQ Artemis connections to clients and to other servers over\ncluster connections. This being the case we need a way of establishing\nthe initial first connection. This can be done using dynamic discovery\ntechniques like\nUDP and\nJGroups, or by providing a list of initial\nconnectors.\nDynamic Discovery\nServer discovery uses\nUDP multicast or\nJGroups to broadcast server connection\nsettings.\nBroadcast Groups\nA broadcast group is the means by which a server broadcasts connectors\nover the network. A connector defines a way in which a client (or other\nserver) can make connections to the server. For more information on what\na connector is, please see Configuring the Transport.\nThe broadcast group takes a set of connector pairs, each connector pair\ncontains connection settings for a live and backup server (if one\nexists) and broadcasts them on the network. Depending on which\nbroadcasting technique you configure the cluster, it uses either UDP or\nJGroups to broadcast connector pairs information.\nBroadcast groups are defined in the server configuration file\nbroker.xml. There can be many broadcast groups per\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis server. All broadcast groups must be defined in a\nbroadcast-groups element.\nLet's take a look at an example broadcast group from\nbroker.xml that defines a UDP broadcast group:\n\n   \n      172.16.9.3\n      5432\n      231.7.7.7\n      9876\n      2000\n      netty-connector\n   \n\nSome of the broadcast group parameters are optional and you'll normally\nuse the defaults, but we specify them all in the above example for\nclarity. Let's discuss each one in turn:\n\nname attribute. Each broadcast group in the server must have a\nunique name.\n\nlocal-bind-address. This is the local bind address that the\ndatagram socket is bound to. If you have multiple network interfaces\non your server, you would specify which one you wish to use for\nbroadcasts by setting this property. If this property is not\nspecified then the socket will be bound to the wildcard address, an\nIP address chosen by the kernel. This is a UDP specific attribute.\n\nlocal-bind-port. If you want to specify a local port to which the\ndatagram socket is bound you can specify it here. Normally you would\njust use the default value of -1 which signifies that an anonymous\nport should be used. This parameter is always specified in\nconjunction with local-bind-address. This is a UDP specific\nattribute.\n\ngroup-address. This is the multicast address to which the data\nwill be broadcast. It is a class D IP address in the range\n224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255, inclusive. The address 224.0.0.0\nis reserved and is not available for use. This parameter is\nmandatory. This is a UDP specific attribute.\n\ngroup-port. This is the UDP port number used for broadcasting.\nThis parameter is mandatory. This is a UDP specific attribute.\n\nbroadcast-period. This is the period in milliseconds between\nconsecutive broadcasts. This parameter is optional, the default\nvalue is 2000 milliseconds.\n\nconnector-ref. This specifies the connector and optional backup\nconnector that will be broadcasted (see Configuring the Transport for more information on\nconnectors). \n\n\nHere is another example broadcast group that defines a JGroups broadcast\ngroup:\n\n   \n      test-jgroups-file_ping.xml\n      activemq_broadcast_channel\n      2000\n      netty-connector\n   \n\nTo be able to use JGroups to broadcast, one must specify two attributes,\ni.e. jgroups-file and jgroups-channel, as discussed in details as\nfollowing:\n\njgroups-file attribute. This is the name of JGroups configuration\nfile. It will be used to initialize JGroups channels. Make sure the\nfile is in the java resource path so that Apache ActiveMQ Artemis can load it.\n\njgroups-channel attribute. The name that JGroups channels connect\nto for broadcasting.\n\n\n\nNote\nThe JGroups attributes (jgroups-file and jgroups-channel) and UDP\nspecific attributes described above are exclusive of each other. Only\none set can be specified in a broadcast group configuration. Don't mix\nthem!\n\nThe following is an example of a JGroups file\n\n   \n\n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n\nAs it shows, the file content defines a jgroups protocol stacks. If you\nwant Apache ActiveMQ Artemis to use this stacks for channel creation, you have to make\nsure the value of jgroups-file in your broadcast-group/discovery-group\nconfiguration to be the name of this jgroups configuration file. For\nexample if the above stacks configuration is stored in a file named\n\"jgroups-stacks.xml\" then your jgroups-file should be like\njgroups-stacks.xml\nDiscovery Groups\nWhile the broadcast group defines how connector information is\nbroadcasted from a server, a discovery group defines how connector\ninformation is received from a broadcast endpoint (a UDP multicast\naddress or JGroup channel).\nA discovery group maintains a list of connector pairs - one for each\nbroadcast by a different server. As it receives broadcasts on the\nbroadcast endpoint from a particular server it updates its entry in the\nlist for that server.\nIf it has not received a broadcast from a particular server for a length\nof time it will remove that server's entry from its list.\nDiscovery groups are used in two places in Apache ActiveMQ Artemis:\n\nBy cluster connections so they know how to obtain an initial\nconnection to download the topology\n\nBy messaging clients so they know how to obtain an initial\nconnection to download the topology\n\n\nAlthough a discovery group will always accept broadcasts, its current\nlist of available live and backup servers is only ever used when an\ninitial connection is made, from then server discovery is done over the\nnormal Apache ActiveMQ Artemis connections.\n\nNote\nEach discovery group must be configured with broadcast endpoint (UDP\nor JGroups) that matches its broadcast group counterpart. For example,\nif broadcast is configured using UDP, the discovery group must also\nuse UDP, and the same multicast address.\n\nDefining Discovery Groups on the Server\nFor cluster connections, discovery groups are defined in the server side\nconfiguration file broker.xml. All discovery groups\nmust be defined inside a discovery-groups element. There can be many\ndiscovery groups defined by Apache ActiveMQ Artemis server. Let's look at an example:\n\n   \n      172.16.9.7\n      231.7.7.7\n      9876\n      10000\n   \n\nWe'll consider each parameter of the discovery group:\n\nname attribute. Each discovery group must have a unique name per\nserver.\n\nlocal-bind-address. If you are running with multiple network\ninterfaces on the same machine, you may want to specify that the\ndiscovery group listens only only a specific interface. To do this\nyou can specify the interface address with this parameter. This\nparameter is optional. This is a UDP specific attribute.\n\ngroup-address. This is the multicast IP address of the group to\nlisten on. It should match the group-address in the broadcast\ngroup that you wish to listen from. This parameter is mandatory.\nThis is a UDP specific attribute.\n\ngroup-port. This is the UDP port of the multicast group. It should\nmatch the group-port in the broadcast group that you wish to\nlisten from. This parameter is mandatory. This is a UDP specific\nattribute.\n\nrefresh-timeout. This is the period the discovery group waits\nafter receiving the last broadcast from a particular server before\nremoving that servers connector pair entry from its list. You would\nnormally set this to a value significantly higher than the\nbroadcast-period on the broadcast group otherwise servers might\nintermittently disappear from the list even though they are still\nbroadcasting due to slight differences in timing. This parameter is\noptional, the default value is 10000 milliseconds (10 seconds).\n\n\nHere is another example that defines a JGroups discovery group:\n\n   \n      test-jgroups-file_ping.xml\n      activemq_broadcast_channel\n      10000\n   \n\nTo receive broadcast from JGroups channels, one must specify two\nattributes, jgroups-file and jgroups-channel, as discussed in\ndetails as following:\n\njgroups-file attribute. This is the name of JGroups configuration\nfile. It will be used to initialize JGroups channels. Make sure the\nfile is in the java resource path so that Apache ActiveMQ Artemis can load it.\n\njgroups-channel attribute. The name that JGroups channels connect\nto for receiving broadcasts.\n\n\n\nNote\nThe JGroups attributes (jgroups-file and jgroups-channel) and UDP\nspecific attributes described above are exclusive of each other. Only\none set can be specified in a discovery group configuration. Don't mix\nthem!\n\nDiscovery Groups on the Client Side\nLet's discuss how to configure an Apache ActiveMQ Artemis client to use discovery to\ndiscover a list of servers to which it can connect. The way to do this\ndiffers depending on whether you're using JMS or the core API.\nConfiguring client discovery\nUse the udp URL scheme and a host:port combination matches the group-address and\ngroup-port from the corresponding broadcast-group on the server:\nudp://231.7.7.7:9876\nThe element discovery-group-ref specifies the name of a discovery\ngroup defined in broker.xml.\nConnections created using this URI will be load-balanced across the\nlist of servers that the discovery group maintains by listening on\nthe multicast address specified in the discovery group configuration.\nThe aforementioned refreshTimeout parameter can be set directly in the URI.\nThere is also a URL parameter named initialWaitTimeout. If the corresponding\nJMS connection factory or core session factory is used immediately after\ncreation then it may not have had enough time to received broadcasts from\nall the nodes in the cluster. On first usage, the connection factory will\nmake sure it waits this long since creation before creating the first\nconnection. The default value for this parameter is 10000 milliseconds.\nDiscovery using static Connectors\nSometimes it may be impossible to use UDP on the network you are using.\nIn this case its possible to configure a connection with an initial list\nif possible servers. This could be just one server that you know will\nalways be available or a list of servers where at least one will be\navailable.\nThis doesn't mean that you have to know where all your servers are going\nto be hosted, you can configure these servers to use the reliable\nservers to connect to. Once they are connected there connection details\nwill be propagated via the server it connects to\nConfiguring a Cluster Connection\nFor cluster connections there is no extra configuration needed, you just\nneed to make sure that any connectors are defined in the usual manner,\n(see Configuring the Transport for more information on connectors). These are then referenced by\nthe cluster connection configuration.\nConfiguring a Client Connection\nA static list of possible servers can also be used by a normal client.\nConfiguring client discovery\nA list of servers to be used for the initial connection attempt can be\nspecified in the connection URI using a syntax with (), e.g.:\n(tcp://myhost:61616,tcp://myhost2:61616)?reconnectAttempts=5\nThe brackets are expanded so the same query can be appended after the last\nbracket for ease.\nServer-Side Message Load Balancing\nIf cluster connections are defined between nodes of a cluster, then\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis will load balance messages arriving at a particular node from a\nclient.\nLet's take a simple example of a cluster of four nodes A, B, C, and D\narranged in a symmetric cluster (described in Symmetrical Clusters section). We have a queue\ncalled OrderQueue deployed on each node of the cluster.\nWe have client Ca connected to node A, sending orders to the server. We\nhave also have order processor clients Pa, Pb, Pc, and Pd connected to\neach of the nodes A, B, C, D. If no cluster connection was defined on\nnode A, then as order messages arrive on node A they will all end up in\nthe OrderQueue on node A, so will only get consumed by the order\nprocessor client attached to node A, Pa.\nIf we define a cluster connection on node A, then as ordered messages\narrive on node A instead of all of them going into the local\nOrderQueue instance, they are distributed in a round-robin fashion\nbetween all the nodes of the cluster. The messages are forwarded from\nthe receiving node to other nodes of the cluster. This is all done on\nthe server side, the client maintains a single connection to node A.\nFor example, messages arriving on node A might be distributed in the\nfollowing order between the nodes: B, D, C, A, B, D, C, A, B, D. The\nexact order depends on the order the nodes started up, but the algorithm\nused is round robin.\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis cluster connections can be configured to always blindly load\nbalance messages in a round robin fashion irrespective of whether there\nare any matching consumers on other nodes, but they can be a bit\ncleverer than that and also be configured to only distribute to other\nnodes if they have matching consumers. We'll look at both these cases in\nturn with some examples, but first we'll discuss configuring cluster\nconnections in general.\nConfiguring Cluster Connections\nCluster connections group servers into clusters so that messages can be\nload balanced between the nodes of the cluster. Let's take a look at a\ntypical cluster connection. Cluster connections are always defined in\nbroker.xml inside a cluster-connection element.\nThere can be zero or more cluster connections defined per Apache ActiveMQ Artemis\nserver.\n\n   \n      \n      netty-connector\n      1000\n      5000\n      50000\n      5000\n      500\n      1.0\n      5000\n      -1\n      -1\n      true\n      ON_DEMAND\n      1\n      32000\n      30000\n      1000\n      2\n      \n   \n\nIn the above cluster connection all parameters have been explicitly\nspecified. The following shows all the available configuration options\n\naddress Each cluster connection only applies to addresses that\nmatch the specified address field. An address is matched on the\ncluster connection when it begins with the string specified in this\nfield. The address field on a cluster connection also supports comma\nseparated lists and an exclude syntax '!'. To prevent an address\nfrom being matched on this cluster connection, prepend a cluster\nconnection address string with '!'.\nIn the case shown above the cluster connection will load balance\nmessages sent to all addresses (since it's empty).\nThe address can be any value and you can have many cluster\nconnections with different values of address, simultaneously\nbalancing messages for those addresses, potentially to different\nclusters of servers. By having multiple cluster connections on\ndifferent addresses a single Apache ActiveMQ Artemis Server can effectively take\npart in multiple clusters simultaneously.\nBe careful not to have multiple cluster connections with overlapping\nvalues of address, e.g. \"europe\" and \"europe.news\" since this\ncould result in the same messages being distributed between more\nthan one cluster connection, possibly resulting in duplicate\ndeliveries.\nExamples:\n\n'eu'\nmatches all addresses starting with 'eu'\n'!eu'\nmatches all address except for those starting with 'eu'\n'eu.uk,eu.de'\nmatches all addresses starting with either 'eu.uk' or\n'eu.de'\n'eu,!eu.uk'\nmatches all addresses starting with 'eu' but not those\nstarting with 'eu.uk'\n\nNotes:\n\nAddress exclusion will always takes precedence over address\ninclusion.\nAddress matching on cluster connections does not support\nwild-card matching.\n\nThis parameter is mandatory.\n\nconnector-ref. This is the connector which will be sent to other\nnodes in the cluster so they have the correct cluster topology.\nThis parameter is mandatory.\n\ncheck-period. The period (in milliseconds) used to check if the\ncluster connection has failed to receive pings from another server.\nDefault is 30000.\n\nconnection-ttl. This is how long a cluster connection should stay\nalive if it stops receiving messages from a specific node in the\ncluster. Default is 60000.\n\nmin-large-message-size. If the message size (in bytes) is larger\nthan this value then it will be split into multiple segments when\nsent over the network to other cluster members. Default is 102400.\n\ncall-timeout. When a packet is sent via a cluster connection and\nis a blocking call, i.e. for acknowledgements, this is how long it\nwill wait (in milliseconds) for the reply before throwing an\nexception. Default is 30000.\n\nretry-interval. We mentioned before that, internally, cluster\nconnections cause bridges to be created between the nodes of the\ncluster. If the cluster connection is created and the target node\nhas not been started, or say, is being rebooted, then the cluster\nconnections from other nodes will retry connecting to the target\nuntil it comes back up, in the same way as a bridge does.\nThis parameter determines the interval in milliseconds between retry\nattempts. It has the same meaning as the retry-interval on a\nbridge (as described in Core Bridges).\nThis parameter is optional and its default value is 500\nmilliseconds.\n\nretry-interval-multiplier. This is a multiplier used to increase\nthe retry-interval after each reconnect attempt, default is 1.\n\nmax-retry-interval. The maximum delay (in milliseconds) for\nretries. Default is 2000.\n\ninitial-connect-attempts. The number of times the system will try\nto connect a node in the cluster initially. If the max-retry is\nachieved this node will be considered permanently down and the\nsystem will not route messages to this node. Default is -1 (infinite\nretries).\n\nreconnect-attempts. The number of times the system will try to\nreconnect to a node in the cluster. If the max-retry is achieved\nthis node will be considered permanently down and the system will\nstop routing messages to this node. Default is -1 (infinite\nretries).\n\nuse-duplicate-detection. Internally cluster connections use\nbridges to link the nodes, and bridges can be configured to add a\nduplicate id property in each message that is forwarded. If the\ntarget node of the bridge crashes and then recovers, messages might\nbe resent from the source node. By enabling duplicate detection any\nduplicate messages will be filtered out and ignored on receipt at\nthe target node.\nThis parameter has the same meaning as use-duplicate-detection on\na bridge. For more information on duplicate detection, please see Duplicate Detection.\nDefault is true.\n\nmessage-load-balancing. This parameter determines if/how\nmessages will be distributed between other nodes of the cluster.\nIt can be one of three values - OFF, STRICT, or ON_DEMAND \n(default). This parameter replaces the deprecated\nforward-when-no-consumers parameter.\nIf this is set to OFF then messages will never be forwarded to\nanother node in the cluster\nIf this is set to STRICT then each incoming message will be round\nrobin'd even though the same queues on the other nodes of the\ncluster may have no consumers at all, or they may have consumers\nthat have non matching message filters (selectors). Note that\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis will not forward messages to other nodes\nif there are no queues of the same name on the other nodes, even\nif this parameter is set to STRICT. Using STRICT is like setting\nthe legacy forward-when-no-consumers parameter to true.\nIf this is set to ON_DEMAND then Apache ActiveMQ Artemis will only\nforward messages to other nodes of the cluster if the address to which\nthey are being forwarded has queues which have consumers, and if those\nconsumers have message filters (selectors) at least one of those\nselectors must match the message. Using ON_DEMAND is like setting\nthe legacy forward-when-no-consumers parameter to false.\nDefault is ON_DEMAND.\n\nmax-hops. When a cluster connection decides the set of nodes to\nwhich it might load balance a message, those nodes do not have to be\ndirectly connected to it via a cluster connection. Apache ActiveMQ Artemis can be\nconfigured to also load balance messages to nodes which might be\nconnected to it only indirectly with other Apache ActiveMQ Artemis servers as\nintermediates in a chain.\nThis allows Apache ActiveMQ Artemis to be configured in more complex topologies and\nstill provide message load balancing. We'll discuss this more later\nin this chapter.\nThe default value for this parameter is 1, which means messages\nare only load balanced to other Apache ActiveMQ Artemis serves which are directly\nconnected to this server. This parameter is optional.\n\nconfirmation-window-size. The size (in bytes) of the window used\nfor sending confirmations from the server connected to. So once the\nserver has received confirmation-window-size bytes it notifies its\nclient, default is 1048576. A value of -1 means no window.\n\nproducer-window-size. The size for producer flow control over cluster connection.\n it's by default disabled through the cluster connection bridge but you may want\n to set a value if you are using really large messages in cluster. A value of -1 means no window.\n\ncall-failover-timeout. Similar to call-timeout but used when a\ncall is made during a failover attempt. Default is -1 (no timeout).\n\nnotification-interval. How often (in milliseconds) the cluster\nconnection should broadcast itself when attaching to the cluster.\nDefault is 1000.\n\nnotification-attempts. How many times the cluster connection\nshould broadcast itself when connecting to the cluster. Default is\n2.\n\ndiscovery-group-ref. This parameter determines which discovery\ngroup is used to obtain the list of other servers in the cluster\nthat this cluster connection will make connections to.\n\n\nAlternatively if you would like your cluster connections to use a static\nlist of servers for discovery then you can do it like this.\n\n   ...\n   \n      server0-connector\n      server1-connector\n   \n\nHere we have defined 2 servers that we know for sure will that at least\none will be available. There may be many more servers in the cluster but\nthese will; be discovered via one of these connectors once an initial\nconnection has been made.\nCluster User Credentials\nWhen creating connections between nodes of a cluster to form a cluster\nconnection, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis uses a cluster user and cluster password which is\ndefined in broker.xml:\nACTIVEMQ.CLUSTER.ADMIN.USER\nCHANGE ME!!\n\nWarning\nIt is imperative that these values are changed from their default, or\nremote clients will be able to make connections to the server using\nthe default values. If they are not changed from the default, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis\nwill detect this and pester you with a warning on every start-up.\n\nClient-Side Load balancing\nWith Apache ActiveMQ Artemis client-side load balancing, subsequent sessions created\nusing a single session factory can be connected to different nodes of\nthe cluster. This allows sessions to spread smoothly across the nodes of\na cluster and not be \"clumped\" on any particular node.\nThe load balancing policy to be used by the client factory is\nconfigurable. Apache ActiveMQ Artemis provides four out-of-the-box load balancing\npolicies, and you can also implement your own and use that.\nThe out-of-the-box policies are\n\nRound Robin. With this policy the first node is chosen randomly then\neach subsequent node is chosen sequentially in the same order.\nFor example nodes might be chosen in the order B, C, D, A, B, C, D,\nA, B or D, A, B, C, D, A, B, C, D or C, D, A, B, C, D, A, B, C.\nUse\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.api.core.client.loadbalance.RoundRobinConnectionLoadBalancingPolicy\nas the .\n\nRandom. With this policy each node is chosen randomly.\nUse\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.api.core.client.loadbalance.RandomConnectionLoadBalancingPolicy\nas the .\n\nRandom Sticky. With this policy the first node is chosen randomly\nand then re-used for subsequent connections.\nUse\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.api.core.client.loadbalance.RandomStickyConnectionLoadBalancingPolicy\nas the .\n\nFirst Element. With this policy the \"first\" (i.e. 0th) node is\nalways returned.\nUse\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.api.core.client.loadbalance.FirstElementConnectionLoadBalancingPolicy\nas the .\n\n\nYou can also implement your own policy by implementing the interface\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.api.core.client.loadbalance.ConnectionLoadBalancingPolicy\nSpecifying which load balancing policy to use differs whether you are\nusing JMS or the core API. If you don't specify a policy then the\ndefault will be used which is\norg.apache.activemq.artemis.api.core.client.loadbalance.RoundRobinConnectionLoadBalancingPolicy.\nThe parameter connectionLoadBalancingPolicyClassName can be set on the URI to\nconfigure what load balancing policy to use:\ntcp://localhost:61616?connectionLoadBalancingPolicyClassName=org.apache.activemq.artemis.api.core.client.loadbalance.RandomConnectionLoadBalancingPolicy\nThe set of servers over which the factory load balances can be\ndetermined in one of two ways:\n\nSpecifying servers explicitly in the URL. This also requires setting\nthe useTopologyForLoadBalancing parameter to false on the URL.\n\nUsing discovery. This is the default behavior.\n\n\nSpecifying Members of a Cluster Explicitly\nSometimes you want to explicitly define a cluster more explicitly, that\nis control which server connect to each other in the cluster. This is\ntypically used to form non symmetrical clusters such as chain cluster or\nring clusters. This can only be done using a static list of connectors\nand is configured as follows:\n\n   jms\n   netty-connector\n   500\n   true\n   STRICT\n   1\n   \n      server1-connector\n   \n\nIn this example we have set the attribute\nallow-direct-connections-only which means that the only server that\nthis server can create a cluster connection to is server1-connector.\nThis means you can explicitly create any cluster topology you want.\nMessage Redistribution\nAnother important part of clustering is message redistribution. Earlier\nwe learned how server side message load balancing round robins messages\nacross the cluster. If message-load-balancing is OFF or ON_DEMAND\nthen messages won't be forwarded to nodes which don't have matching\nconsumers. This is great and ensures that messages aren't moved to a\nqueue which has no consumers to consume them. However, there is a\nsituation it doesn't solve: What happens if the consumers on a queue\nclose after the messages have been sent to the node? If there are no\nconsumers on the queue the message won't get consumed and we have a\nstarvation situation.\nThis is where message redistribution comes in. With message\nredistribution Apache ActiveMQ Artemis can be configured to automatically\nredistribute messages from queues which have no consumers back to\nother nodes in the cluster which do have matching consumers. To enable\nthis functionality message-load-balancing must be ON_DEMAND.\nMessage redistribution can be configured to kick in immediately after\nthe last consumer on a queue is closed, or to wait a configurable delay\nafter the last consumer on a queue is closed before redistributing. By\ndefault message redistribution is disabled.\nMessage redistribution can be configured on a per address basis, by\nspecifying the redistribution delay in the address settings, for more\ninformation on configuring address settings, please see Queue Attributes.\nHere's an address settings snippet from broker.xml\nshowing how message redistribution is enabled for a set of queues:\n\n   \n      0\n   \n\nThe above address-settings block would set a redistribution-delay of\n0 for any queue which is bound to any address. So the above would enable\ninstant (no delay) redistribution for all addresses.\nThe attribute match can be an exact match or it can be a string that\nconforms to the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis wildcard syntax (described in Wildcard Syntax).\nThe element redistribution-delay defines the delay in milliseconds\nafter the last consumer is closed on a queue before redistributing\nmessages from that queue to other nodes of the cluster which do have\nmatching consumers. A delay of zero means the messages will be\nimmediately redistributed. A value of -1 signifies that messages will\nnever be redistributed. The default value is -1.\nIt often makes sense to introduce a delay before redistributing as it's\na common case that a consumer closes but another one quickly is created\non the same queue, in such a case you probably don't want to\nredistribute immediately since the new consumer will arrive shortly.\nCluster topologies\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis clusters can be connected together in many different\ntopologies, let's consider the two most common ones here\nSymmetric cluster\nA symmetric cluster is probably the most common cluster topology.\nWith a symmetric cluster every node in the cluster is connected to every\nother node in the cluster. In other words every node in the cluster is\nno more than one hop away from every other node.\nTo form a symmetric cluster every node in the cluster defines a cluster\nconnection with the attribute max-hops set to 1. Typically the\ncluster connection will use server discovery in order to know what other\nservers in the cluster it should connect to, although it is possible to\nexplicitly define each target server too in the cluster connection if,\nfor example, UDP is not available on your network.\nWith a symmetric cluster each node knows about all the queues that exist\non all the other nodes and what consumers they have. With this knowledge\nit can determine how to load balance and redistribute messages around\nthe nodes.\nDon't forget this warning when creating a symmetric\ncluster.\nChain cluster\nWith a chain cluster, each node in the cluster is not connected to every\nnode in the cluster directly, instead the nodes form a chain with a node\non each end of the chain and all other nodes just connecting to the\nprevious and next nodes in the chain.\nAn example of this would be a three node chain consisting of nodes A, B\nand C. Node A is hosted in one network and has many producer clients\nconnected to it sending order messages. Due to corporate policy, the\norder consumer clients need to be hosted in a different network, and\nthat network is only accessible via a third network. In this setup node\nB acts as a mediator with no producers or consumers on it. Any messages\narriving on node A will be forwarded to node B, which will in turn\nforward them to node C where they can get consumed. Node A does not need\nto directly connect to C, but all the nodes can still act as a part of\nthe cluster.\nTo set up a cluster in this way, node A would define a cluster\nconnection that connects to node B, and node B would define a cluster\nconnection that connects to node C. In this case we only want cluster\nconnections in one direction since we're only moving messages from node\nA->B->C and never from C->B->A.\nFor this topology we would set max-hops to 2. With a value of 2\nthe knowledge of what queues and consumers that exist on node C would be\npropagated from node C to node B to node A. Node A would then know to\ndistribute messages to node B when they arrive, even though node B has\nno consumers itself, it would know that a further hop away is node C\nwhich does have consumers.\nScaling Down\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis supports scaling down a cluster with no message loss (even for\nnon-durable messages). This is especially useful in certain environments\n(e.g. the cloud) where the size of a cluster may change relatively\nfrequently. When scaling up a cluster (i.e. adding nodes) there is no\nrisk of message loss, but when scaling down a cluster (i.e. removing\nnodes) the messages on those nodes would be lost unless the broker sent\nthem to another node in the cluster. Apache ActiveMQ Artemis can be configured to do\njust that.\nThe simplest way to enable this behavior is to set scale-down to\ntrue. If the server is clustered and scale-down is true then when\nthe server is shutdown gracefully (i.e. stopped without crashing) it\nwill find another node in the cluster and send all of its messages\n(both durable and non-durable) to that node. The messages are processed\nin order and go to the back of the respective queues on the other node\n(just as if the messages were sent from an external client for the first\ntime).\nIf more control over where the messages go is required then specify\nscale-down-group-name. Messages will only be sent to another node in\nthe cluster that uses the same scale-down-group-name as the server\nbeing shutdown.\n\nWarning\nIf cluster nodes are grouped together with different\nscale-down-group-name values beware. If all the nodes in a single\ngroup are shut down then the messages from that node/group will be\nlost.\n\nIf the server is using multiple cluster-connection then use\nscale-down-clustername to identify the name of the\ncluster-connection which should be used for scaling down.\n"},"ha.html":{"url":"ha.html","title":"High Availability and Failover","keywords":"","body":"High Availability and Failover\nWe define high availability as the ability for the system to continue\nfunctioning after failure of one or more of the servers.\nA part of high availability is failover which we define as the\nability for client connections to migrate from one server to another in\nevent of server failure so client applications can continue to operate.\nLive - Backup Groups\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis allows servers to be linked together as live - backup groups\nwhere each live server can have 1 or more backup servers. A backup\nserver is owned by only one live server. Backup servers are not\noperational until failover occurs, however 1 chosen backup, which will\nbe in passive mode, announces its status and waits to take over the live\nservers work\nBefore failover, only the live server is serving the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis clients\nwhile the backup servers remain passive or awaiting to become a backup\nserver. When a live server crashes or is brought down in the correct\nmode, the backup server currently in passive mode will become live and\nanother backup server will become passive. If a live server restarts\nafter a failover then it will have priority and be the next server to\nbecome live when the current live server goes down, if the current live\nserver is configured to allow automatic failback then it will detect the\nlive server coming back up and automatically stop.\nHA Policies\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis supports two different strategies for backing up a server\nshared store and replication. Which is configured via the\nha-policy configuration element.\n\n  \n\nor\n\n   \n\nAs well as these 2 strategies there is also a 3rd called live-only.\nThis of course means there will be no Backup Strategy and is the default\nif none is provided, however this is used to configure scale-down\nwhich we will cover in a later chapter.\n\nNote\nThe ha-policy configurations replaces any current HA configuration\nin the root of the broker.xml configuration. All old\nconfiguration is now deprecated although best efforts will be made to\nhonour it if configured this way.\nNote\nOnly persistent message data will survive failover. Any non persistent\nmessage data will not be available after failover.\n\nThe ha-policy type configures which strategy a cluster should use to\nprovide the backing up of a servers data. Within this configuration\nelement is configured how a server should behave within the cluster,\neither as a master (live), slave (backup) or colocated (both live and\nbackup). This would look something like:\n\n   \n      \n   \n\nor\n\n   \n      \n   \n\nor\n\n   \n      \n   \n\nData Replication\nWhen using replication, the live and the backup servers do not share the\nsame data directories, all data synchronization is done over the\nnetwork. Therefore all (persistent) data received by the live server\nwill be duplicated to the backup.\nNotice that upon start-up the backup server will first need to\nsynchronize all existing data from the live server before becoming\ncapable of replacing the live server should it fail. So unlike when\nusing shared storage, a replicating backup will not be a fully\noperational backup right after start-up, but only after it finishes\nsynchronizing the data with its live server. The time it will take for\nthis to happen will depend on the amount of data to be synchronized and\nthe connection speed.\n\nNote\nIn general, synchronization occurs in parallel with current network traffic so\nthis won't cause any blocking on current clients. However, there is a critical\nmoment at the end of this process where the replicating server must complete\nthe synchronization and ensure the replica acknowledges this completion. This\nexchange between the replicating server and replica will block any journal\nrelated operations. The maximum length of time that this exchange will block\nis controlled by the initial-replication-sync-timeout configuration element.\n\nReplication will create a copy of the data at the backup. One issue to\nbe aware of is: in case of a successful fail-over, the backup's data\nwill be newer than the one at the live's storage. If you configure your\nlive server to perform a failback to live server when restarted, it will synchronize its data\nwith the backup's. If both servers are shutdown, the administrator will\nhave to determine which one has the latest data.\nThe replicating live and backup pair must be part of a cluster. The\nCluster Connection also defines how backup servers will find the remote\nlive servers to pair with. Refer to Clusters for details on how this is done,\nand how to configure a cluster connection. Notice that:\n\nBoth live and backup servers must be part of the same cluster.\nNotice that even a simple live/backup replicating pair will require\na cluster configuration.\n\nTheir cluster user and password must match.\n\n\nWithin a cluster, there are two ways that a backup server will locate a\nlive server to replicate from, these are:\n\nspecifying a node group. You can specify a group of live servers\nthat a backup server can connect to. This is done by configuring\ngroup-name in either the master or the slave element of the\nbroker.xml. A Backup server will only connect to a\nlive server that shares the same node group name\n\nconnecting to any live. This will be the behaviour if group-name\nis not configured allowing a backup server to connect to any live\nserver\n\n\n\nNote\nA group-name example: suppose you have 5 live servers and 6 backup\nservers:\n\nlive1, live2, live3: with group-name=fish\n\nlive4, live5: with group-name=bird\n\nbackup1, backup2, backup3, backup4: with group-name=fish\n\nbackup5, backup6: with group-name=bird\n\n\nAfter joining the cluster the backups with group-name=fish will\nsearch for live servers with group-name=fish to pair with. Since\nthere is one backup too many, the fish will remain with one spare\nbackup.\nThe 2 backups with group-name=bird (backup5 and backup6) will\npair with live servers live4 and live5.\n\nThe backup will search for any live server that it is configured to\nconnect to. It then tries to replicate with each live server in turn\nuntil it finds a live server that has no current backup configured. If\nno live server is available it will wait until the cluster topology\nchanges and repeats the process.\n\nNote\nThis is an important distinction from a shared-store backup, if a\nbackup starts and does not find a live server, the server will just\nactivate and start to serve client requests. In the replication case,\nthe backup just keeps waiting for a live server to pair with. Note\nthat in replication the backup server does not know whether any data\nit might have is up to date, so it really cannot decide to activate\nautomatically. To activate a replicating backup server using the data\nit has, the administrator must change its configuration to make it a\nlive server by changing slave to master.\n\nMuch like in the shared-store case, when the live server stops or\ncrashes, its replicating backup will become active and take over its\nduties. Specifically, the backup will become active when it loses\nconnection to its live server. This can be problematic because this can\nalso happen because of a temporary network problem. In order to address\nthis issue, the backup will try to determine whether it still can\nconnect to the other servers in the cluster. If it can connect to more\nthan half the servers, it will become active, if more than half the\nservers also disappeared with the live, the backup will wait and try\nreconnecting with the live. This avoids a split brain situation.\nConfiguration\nTo configure the live and backup servers to be a replicating pair,\nconfigure the live server in ' broker.xml to have:\n\n   \n      \n   \n\n.\n\n   \n      ...\n   \n\nThe backup server must be similarly configured but as a slave\n\n   \n      \n   \n\nAll Replication Configuration\nThe following table lists all the ha-policy configuration elements for\nHA strategy Replication for master:\n\n    \n        \n        \n    \n    \n    \n        Name\n        Description\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        `check-for-live-server`\n        Whether to check the cluster for a (live) server using our own server ID\n        when starting up. This option is only necessary for performing 'fail-back'\n        on replicating servers.\n    \n    \n        `cluster-name`\n        Name of the cluster configuration to use for replication. This setting is\n        only necessary if you configure multiple cluster connections. If configured then\n        the connector configuration of the cluster configuration with this name will be\n        used when connecting to the cluster to discover if a live server is already running,\n        see `check-for-live-server`. If unset then the default cluster connections configuration\n        is used (the first one configured).\n    \n    \n        `group-name`\n        If set, backup servers will only pair with live servers with matching group-name.\n    \n    \n        `initial-replication-sync-timeout`\n        The amount of time the replicating server will wait at the completion of the initial\n        replication process for the replica to acknowledge it has received all the necessary\n        data. The default is 30,000 milliseconds. Note: during this interval any\n        journal related operations will be blocked.\n    \n    \n\n\nThe following table lists all the ha-policy configuration elements for\nHA strategy Replication for slave:\n\n    \n        \n        \n    \n    \n    \n        Name\n        Description\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        `cluster-name`\n        Name of the cluster configuration to use for replication.\n        This setting is only necessary if you configure multiple cluster\n        connections. If configured then the connector configuration of\n        the cluster configuration with this name will be used when\n        connecting to the cluster to discover if a live server is already\n        running, see `check-for-live-server`. If unset then the default\n        cluster connections configuration is used (the first one configured)\n    \n    \n        `group-name`\n        If set, backup servers will only pair with live servers with matching group-name\n    \n    \n        `max-saved-replicated-journals-size`\n        This specifies how many times a replicated backup server\n        can restart after moving its files on start. Once there are\n        this number of backup journal files the server will stop permanently\n        after if fails back.\n    \n    \n        `allow-failback`\n        Whether a server will automatically stop when a another places a\n        request to take over its place. The use case is when the backup has\n        failed over\n    \n    \n        `initial-replication-sync-timeout`\n        After failover and the slave has become live, this is\n        set on the new live server. It represents the amount of time\n        the replicating server will wait at the completion of the\n        initial replication process for the replica to acknowledge\n        it has received all the necessary data. The default is\n        30,000 milliseconds. Note: during this interval any\n        journal related operations will be blocked.\n    \n    \n\n\nShared Store\nWhen using a shared store, both live and backup servers share the same\nentire data directory using a shared file system. This means the paging\ndirectory, journal directory, large messages and binding journal.\nWhen failover occurs and a backup server takes over, it will load the\npersistent storage from the shared file system and clients can connect\nto it.\nThis style of high availability differs from data replication in that it\nrequires a shared file system which is accessible by both the live and\nbackup nodes. Typically this will be some kind of high performance\nStorage Area Network (SAN). We do not recommend you use Network Attached\nStorage (NAS), e.g. NFS mounts to store any shared journal (NFS is\nslow).\nThe advantage of shared-store high availability is that no replication\noccurs between the live and backup nodes, this means it does not suffer\nany performance penalties due to the overhead of replication during\nnormal operation.\nThe disadvantage of shared store replication is that it requires a\nshared file system, and when the backup server activates it needs to\nload the journal from the shared store which can take some time\ndepending on the amount of data in the store.\nIf you require the highest performance during normal operation, have\naccess to a fast SAN and live with a slightly slower failover (depending\non amount of data).\n\nConfiguration\nTo configure the live and backup servers to share their store, configure\nid via the ha-policy configuration in broker.xml:\n\n   \n      \n   \n\n.\n\n   \n...\n   \n\nThe backup server must also be configured as a backup.\n\n   \n      \n   \n\nIn order for live - backup groups to operate properly with a shared\nstore, both servers must have configured the location of journal\ndirectory to point to the same shared location (as explained in Configuring the message journal)\n\nNote\ntodo write something about GFS\n\nAlso each node, live and backups, will need to have a cluster connection\ndefined even if not part of a cluster. The Cluster Connection info\ndefines how backup servers announce there presence to its live server or\nany other nodes in the cluster. Refer to Clusters for details on how this is\ndone.\nFailing Back to live Server\nAfter a live server has failed and a backup taken has taken over its\nduties, you may want to restart the live server and have clients fail\nback.\nIn case of \"shared disk\", simply restart the original live server and\nkill the new live server by can do this by killing the process itself.\nAlternatively you can set allow-fail-back to true on the slave\nconfig which will force the backup that has become live to automatically\nstop. This configuration would look like:\n\n   \n      \n         true\n      \n   \n\nIn replication HA mode you need to set an extra property\ncheck-for-live-server to true in the master configuration. If set\nto true, during start-up a live server will first search the cluster for\nanother server using its nodeID. If it finds one, it will contact this\nserver and try to \"fail-back\". Since this is a remote replication\nscenario, the \"starting live\" will have to synchronize its data with the\nserver running with its ID, once they are in sync, it will request the\nother server (which it assumes it is a back that has assumed its duties)\nto shutdown for it to take over. This is necessary because otherwise the\nlive server has no means to know whether there was a fail-over or not,\nand if there was if the server that took its duties is still running or\nnot. To configure this option at your broker.xml\nconfiguration file as follows:\n\n   \n      \n         true\n      \n   \n\n\nWarning\nBe aware that if you restart a live server while after failover has\noccurred then check-for-live-server must be set to true. If not the live server\nwill restart and server the same messages that the backup has already\nhandled causing duplicates.\n\nIt is also possible, in the case of shared store, to cause failover to\noccur on normal server shutdown, to enable this set the following\nproperty to true in the ha-policy configuration on either the master\nor slave like so:\n\n   \n      \n         true\n      \n   \n\nBy default this is set to false, if by some chance you have set this to\nfalse but still want to stop the server normally and cause failover then\nyou can do this by using the management API as explained at Management\nYou can also force the running live server to shutdown when the old live\nserver comes back up allowing the original live server to take over\nautomatically by setting the following property in the\nbroker.xml configuration file as follows:\n\n   \n      \n         true\n      \n   \n\nAll Shared Store Configuration\nThe following table lists all the ha-policy configuration elements for\nHA strategy shared store for master:\n\n    \n        \n        \n    \n    \n    \n        Name\n        Description\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        `failover-on-server-shutdown`\n        If set to true then when this server is stopped\n        normally the backup will become live assuming failover.\n        If false then the backup server will remain passive.\n        Note that if false you want failover to occur the you\n        can use the the management API as explained at [Management](management.md)\n    \n    \n        `wait-for-activation`\n        If set to true then server startup will wait until it is activated.\n        If set to false then server startup will be done in the background.\n        Default is true.\n    \n    \n\n\nThe following table lists all the ha-policy configuration elements for\nHA strategy Shared Store for slave:\n\n    \n        \n        \n    \n    \n    \n        Name\n        Description\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        `failover-on-server-shutdown`\n        In the case of a backup that has become live. then\n        when set to true then when this server is stopped normally\n        the backup will become liveassuming failover. If false then\n        the backup server will remain passive. Note that if false\n        you want failover to occur the you can use the the management\n        API as explained at [Management](management.md)\n    \n    \n        `allow-failback`\n        Whether a server will automatically stop when a another\n        places a request to take over its place. The use case is\n        when the backup has failed over.\n    \n    \n\n\nColocated Backup Servers\nIt is also possible when running standalone to colocate backup servers\nin the same JVM as another live server. Live Servers can be configured\nto request another live server in the cluster to start a backup server\nin the same JVM either using shared store or replication. The new backup\nserver will inherit its configuration from the live server creating it\napart from its name, which will be set to colocated_backup_n where n\nis the number of backups the server has created, and any directories and\nits Connectors and Acceptors which are discussed later on in this\nchapter. A live server can also be configured to allow requests from\nbackups and also how many backups a live server can start. this way you\ncan evenly distribute backups around the cluster. This is configured via\nthe ha-policy element in the broker.xml file like\nso:\n\n   \n      \n         true\n         1\n         -1\n         5000\n         \n         \n      \n   \n\nthe above example is configured to use replication, in this case the\nmaster and slave configurations must match those for normal\nreplication as in the previous chapter. shared-store is also supported\n\nConfiguring Connectors and Acceptors\nIf the HA Policy is colocated then connectors and acceptors will be\ninherited from the live server creating it and offset depending on the\nsetting of backup-port-offset configuration element. If this is set to\nsay 100 (which is the default) and a connector is using port 61616 then\nthis will be set to 5545 for the first server created, 5645 for the\nsecond and so on.\n\nNote\nfor INVM connectors and Acceptors the id will have\ncolocated_backup_n appended, where n is the backup server number.\n\nRemote Connectors\nIt may be that some of the Connectors configured are for external\nservers and hence should be excluded from the offset. for instance a\nConnector used by the cluster connection to do quorum voting for a\nreplicated backup server, these can be omitted from being offset by\nadding them to the ha-policy configuration like so:\n\n   \n      \n         \n            remote-connector\n         \n.........\n\nConfiguring Directories\nDirectories for the Journal, Large messages and Paging will be set\naccording to what the HA strategy is. If shared store the the requesting\nserver will notify the target server of which directories to use. If\nreplication is configured then directories will be inherited from the\ncreating server but have the new backups name appended.\nThe following table lists all the ha-policy configuration elements for colocated policy:\n\n    \n        \n        \n    \n    \n    \n        Name\n        Description\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        `request-backup`\n        If true then the server will request a backup on another node\n    \n    \n        `backup-request-retries`\n        How many times the live server will try to request a backup, -1 means for ever.\n    \n    \n        `backup-request-retry-interval`\n        How long to wait for retries between attempts to request a backup server.\n    \n    \n        `max-backups`\n        How many backups a live server can create\n    \n    \n        `backup-port-offset`\n        The offset to use for the Connectors and Acceptors when creating a new backup server.\n    \n    \n\n\nScaling Down\nAn alternative to using Live/Backup groups is to configure scaledown.\nwhen configured for scale down a server can copy all its messages and\ntransaction state to another live server. The advantage of this is that\nyou dont need full backups to provide some form of HA, however there are\ndisadvantages with this approach the first being that it only deals with\na server being stopped and not a server crash. The caveat here is if you\nconfigure a backup to scale down.\nAnother disadvantage is that it is possible to lose message ordering.\nThis happens in the following scenario, say you have 2 live servers and\nmessages are distributed evenly between the servers from a single\nproducer, if one of the servers scales down then the messages sent back\nto the other server will be in the queue after the ones already there,\nso server 1 could have messages 1,3,5,7,9 and server 2 would have\n2,4,6,8,10, if server 2 scales down the order in server 1 would be\n1,3,5,7,9,2,4,6,8,10.\n\nThe configuration for a live server to scale down would be something\nlike:\n\n   \n      \n         \n            server1-connector\n         \n      \n   \n\nIn this instance the server is configured to use a specific connector to\nscale down, if a connector is not specified then the first INVM\nconnector is chosen, this is to make scale down fromm a backup server\neasy to configure. It is also possible to use discovery to scale down,\nthis would look like:\n\n   \n      \n         \n      \n   \n\nScale Down with groups\nIt is also possible to configure servers to only scale down to servers\nthat belong in the same group. This is done by configuring the group\nlike so:\n\n   \n      \n         ...\n         my-group\n      \n   \n\nIn this scenario only servers that belong to the group my-group will\nbe scaled down to\nScale Down and Backups\nIt is also possible to mix scale down with HA via backup servers. If a\nslave is configured to scale down then after failover has occurred,\ninstead of starting fully the backup server will immediately scale down\nto another live server. The most appropriate configuration for this is\nusing the colocated approach. it means as you bring up live server\nthey will automatically be backed up by server and as live servers are\nshutdown, there messages are made available on another live server. A\ntypical configuration would look like:\n\n   \n      \n         44\n         33\n         3\n         false\n         33\n         \n            purple\n            true\n            abcdefg\n         \n         \n            tiddles\n            22\n            33rrrrr\n            false\n            \n               \n               boo!\n               \n               \n            \n         \n      \n   \n\nScale Down and Clients\nWhen a server is stopping and preparing to scale down it will send a\nmessage to all its clients informing them which server it is scaling\ndown to before disconnecting them. At this point the client will\nreconnect however this will only succeed once the server has completed\nscaledown. This is to ensure that any state such as queues or\ntransactions are there for the client when it reconnects. The normal\nreconnect settings apply when the client is reconnecting so these should\nbe high enough to deal with the time needed to scale down.\nFailover Modes\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis defines two types of client failover:\n\nAutomatic client failover\n\nApplication-level client failover\n\n\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis also provides 100% transparent automatic reattachment of\nconnections to the same server (e.g. in case of transient network\nproblems). This is similar to failover, except it is reconnecting to the\nsame server and is discussed in Client Reconnection and Session Reattachment\nDuring failover, if the client has consumers on any non persistent or\ntemporary queues, those queues will be automatically recreated during\nfailover on the backup node, since the backup node will not have any\nknowledge of non persistent queues.\nAutomatic Client Failover\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis clients can be configured to receive knowledge of all live and\nbackup servers, so that in event of connection failure at the client -\nlive server connection, the client will detect this and reconnect to the\nbackup server. The backup server will then automatically recreate any\nsessions and consumers that existed on each connection before failover,\nthus saving the user from having to hand-code manual reconnection logic.\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis clients detect connection failure when it has not received\npackets from the server within the time given by\nclient-failure-check-period as explained in section Detecting Dead Connections. If the client\ndoes not receive data in good time, it will assume the connection has\nfailed and attempt failover. Also if the socket is closed by the OS,\nusually if the server process is killed rather than the machine itself\ncrashing, then the client will failover straight away.\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis clients can be configured to discover the list of live-backup\nserver groups in a number of different ways. They can be configured\nexplicitly or probably the most common way of doing this is to use\nserver discovery for the client to automatically discover the list.\nFor full details on how to configure server discovery, please see Clusters.\nAlternatively, the clients can explicitly connect to a specific server\nand download the current servers and backups see Clusters.\nTo enable automatic client failover, the client must be configured to\nallow non-zero reconnection attempts (as explained in Client Reconnection and Session Reattachment).\nBy default failover will only occur after at least one connection has\nbeen made to the live server. In other words, by default, failover will\nnot occur if the client fails to make an initial connection to the live\nserver - in this case it will simply retry connecting to the live server\naccording to the reconnect-attempts property and fail after this number\nof attempts.\nFailing over on the Initial Connection\nSince the client does not learn about the full topology until after the\nfirst connection is made there is a window where it does not know about\nthe backup. If a failure happens at this point the client can only try\nreconnecting to the original live server. To configure how many attempts\nthe client will make you can set the URL parameter initialConnectAttempts.\nThe default for this is 0, that is try only once. Once the number of\nattempts has been made an exception will be thrown.\nFor examples of automatic failover with transacted and non-transacted\nJMS sessions, please see the examples chapter.\nA Note on Server Replication\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis does not replicate full server state between live and backup\nservers. When the new session is automatically recreated on the backup\nit won't have any knowledge of messages already sent or acknowledged in\nthat session. Any in-flight sends or acknowledgements at the time of\nfailover might also be lost.\nBy replicating full server state, theoretically we could provide a 100%\ntransparent seamless failover, which would avoid any lost messages or\nacknowledgements, however this comes at a great cost: replicating the\nfull server state (including the queues, session, etc.). This would\nrequire replication of the entire server state machine; every operation\non the live server would have to replicated on the replica server(s) in\nthe exact same global order to ensure a consistent replica state. This\nis extremely hard to do in a performant and scalable way, especially\nwhen one considers that multiple threads are changing the live server\nstate concurrently.\nIt is possible to provide full state machine replication using\ntechniques such as virtual synchrony, but this does not scale well and\neffectively serializes all operations to a single thread, dramatically\nreducing concurrency.\nOther techniques for multi-threaded active replication exist such as\nreplicating lock states or replicating thread scheduling but this is\nvery hard to achieve at a Java level.\nConsequently it has decided it was not worth massively reducing\nperformance and concurrency for the sake of 100% transparent failover.\nEven without 100% transparent failover, it is simple to guarantee once\nand only once delivery, even in the case of failure, by using a\ncombination of duplicate detection and retrying of transactions. However\nthis is not 100% transparent to the client code.\nHandling Blocking Calls During Failover\nIf the client code is in a blocking call to the server, waiting for a\nresponse to continue its execution, when failover occurs, the new\nsession will not have any knowledge of the call that was in progress.\nThis call might otherwise hang for ever, waiting for a response that\nwill never come.\nTo prevent this, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis will unblock any blocking calls that were in\nprogress at the time of failover by making them throw a\njavax.jms.JMSException (if using JMS), or a ActiveMQException with\nerror code ActiveMQException.UNBLOCKED. It is up to the client code to\ncatch this exception and retry any operations if desired.\nIf the method being unblocked is a call to commit(), or prepare(), then\nthe transaction will be automatically rolled back and Apache ActiveMQ Artemis will\nthrow a javax.jms.TransactionRolledBackException (if using JMS), or a\nActiveMQException with error code\nActiveMQException.TRANSACTION_ROLLED_BACK if using the core API.\nHandling Failover With Transactions\nIf the session is transactional and messages have already been sent or\nacknowledged in the current transaction, then the server cannot be sure\nthat messages sent or acknowledgements have not been lost during the\nfailover.\nConsequently the transaction will be marked as rollback-only, and any\nsubsequent attempt to commit it will throw a\njavax.jms.TransactionRolledBackException (if using JMS), or a\nActiveMQException with error code\nActiveMQException.TRANSACTION_ROLLED_BACK if using the core API.\n\nWarning\nThe caveat to this rule is when XA is used either via JMS or through\nthe core API. If 2 phase commit is used and prepare has already been\ncalled then rolling back could cause a HeuristicMixedException.\nBecause of this the commit will throw a XAException.XA_RETRY\nexception. This informs the Transaction Manager that it should retry\nthe commit at some later point in time, a side effect of this is that\nany non persistent messages will be lost. To avoid this use persistent\nmessages when using XA. With acknowledgements this is not an issue\nsince they are flushed to the server before prepare gets called.\n\nIt is up to the user to catch the exception, and perform any client side\nlocal rollback code as necessary. There is no need to manually rollback\nthe session - it is already rolled back. The user can then just retry\nthe transactional operations again on the same session.\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis ships with a fully functioning example demonstrating how to do\nthis, please see the examples chapter.\nIf failover occurs when a commit call is being executed, the server, as\npreviously described, will unblock the call to prevent a hang, since no\nresponse will come back. In this case it is not easy for the client to\ndetermine whether the transaction commit was actually processed on the\nlive server before failure occurred.\n\nNote\nIf XA is being used either via JMS or through the core API then an\nXAException.XA_RETRY is thrown. This is to inform Transaction\nManagers that a retry should occur at some point. At some later point\nin time the Transaction Manager will retry the commit. If the original\ncommit has not occurred then it will still exist and be committed, if\nit does not exist then it is assumed to have been committed although\nthe transaction manager may log a warning.\n\nTo remedy this, the client can simply enable duplicate detection (Duplicate Message Detection) in\nthe transaction, and retry the transaction operations again after the\ncall is unblocked. If the transaction had indeed been committed on the\nlive server successfully before failover, then when the transaction is\nretried, duplicate detection will ensure that any durable messages\nresent in the transaction will be ignored on the server to prevent them\ngetting sent more than once.\n\nNote\nBy catching the rollback exceptions and retrying, catching unblocked\ncalls and enabling duplicate detection, once and only once delivery\nguarantees for messages can be provided in the case of failure,\nguaranteeing 100% no loss or duplication of messages.\n\nHandling Failover With Non Transactional Sessions\nIf the session is non transactional, messages or acknowledgements can be\nlost in the event of failover.\nIf you wish to provide once and only once delivery guarantees for non\ntransacted sessions too, enabled duplicate detection, and catch unblock\nexceptions as described in Handling Blocking Calls During Failover\nGetting Notified of Connection Failure\nJMS provides a standard mechanism for getting notified asynchronously of\nconnection failure: java.jms.ExceptionListener. Please consult the JMS\njavadoc or any good JMS tutorial for more information on how to use\nthis.\nThe Apache ActiveMQ Artemis core API also provides a similar feature in the form of the\nclass org.apache.activemq.artemis.core.client.SessionFailureListener\nAny ExceptionListener or SessionFailureListener instance will always be\ncalled by ActiveMQ Artemis on event of connection failure, irrespective of\nwhether the connection was successfully failed over, reconnected or\nreattached, however you can find out if reconnect or reattach has\nhappened by either the failedOver flag passed in on the\nconnectionFailed on SessionfailureListener or by inspecting the\nerror code on the javax.jms.JMSException which will be one of the\nfollowing:\nJMSException error codes\n\n    \n        \n        \n    \n    \n    \n        Error code\n        Description\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        FAILOVER\n        Failover has occurred and we have successfully reattached or reconnected.\n    \n    \n        DISCONNECT\n        No failover has occurred and we are disconnected.\n    \n    \n\n\nApplication-Level Failover\nIn some cases you may not want automatic client failover, and prefer to\nhandle any connection failure yourself, and code your own manually\nreconnection logic in your own failure handler. We define this as\napplication-level failover, since the failover is handled at the user\napplication level.\nTo implement application-level failover, if you're using JMS then you\nneed to set an ExceptionListener class on the JMS connection. The\nExceptionListener will be called by Apache ActiveMQ Artemis in the event that\nconnection failure is detected. In your ExceptionListener, you would\nclose your old JMS connections, potentially look up new connection\nfactory instances from JNDI and creating new connections.\nFor a working example of application-level failover, please see the examples chapter.\nIf you are using the core API, then the procedure is very similar: you\nwould set a FailureListener on the core ClientSession instances.\n"},"graceful-shutdown.html":{"url":"graceful-shutdown.html","title":"Graceful Server Shutdown","keywords":"","body":"Graceful Server Shutdown\nIn certain circumstances an administrator might not want to disconnect\nall clients immediately when stopping the broker.

A Java scheduled thread pool\ncannot be configured to use a standard thread pool, otherwise we could\nuse a single thread pool for both scheduled and non scheduled activity.\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis will, by default, cap its thread pool\nat three times the number of cores (or hyper-threads) as reported by Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors() for processing\nincoming packets. To override this value, you can set the number of\nthreads by specifying the parameter nioRemotingThreads in the\ntransport configuration. See the configuring transports\nfor more information on this.\nThere are also a small number of other places where threads are used\ndirectly, we'll discuss each in turn.\nServer Scheduled Thread Pool\nThe server scheduled thread pool is used for most activities on the\nserver side that require running periodically or with delays. It maps\ninternally to a java.util.concurrent.ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor\ninstance.\nThe maximum number of thread used by this pool is configure in\nbroker.xml with the scheduled-thread-pool-max-size\nparameter. The default value is 5 threads. A small number of threads\nis usually sufficient for this pool.\nGeneral Purpose Server Thread Pool\nThis general purpose thread pool is used for most asynchronous actions\non the server side. It maps internally to a\njava.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor instance.\nThe maximum number of thread used by this pool is configure in\nbroker.xml with the thread-pool-max-size parameter.\nIf a value of -1 is used this signifies that the thread pool has no\nupper bound and new threads will be created on demand if there are not\nenough threads available to satisfy a request. If activity later\nsubsides then threads are timed-out and closed.\nIf a value of n where nis a positive integer greater than zero is\nused this signifies that the thread pool is bounded. If more requests\ncome in and there are no free threads in the pool and the pool is full\nthen requests will block until a thread becomes available. It is\nrecommended that a bounded thread pool is used with caution since it can\nlead to dead-lock situations if the upper bound is chosen to be too low.\nThe default value for thread-pool-max-size is 30.\nSee the J2SE\njavadoc\nfor more information on unbounded (cached), and bounded (fixed) thread\npools.\nExpiry Reaper Thread\nA single thread is also used on the server side to scan for expired\nmessages in queues. We cannot use either of the thread pools for this\nsince this thread needs to run at its own configurable priority.\nFor more information on configuring the reaper, please see message expiry.\nAsynchronous IO\nAsynchronous IO has a thread pool for receiving and dispatching events\nout of the native layer. You will find it on a thread dump with the\nprefix ActiveMQ-AIO-poller-pool. Apache ActiveMQ Artemis uses one thread per opened\nfile on the journal (there is usually one).\nThere is also a single thread used to invoke writes on libaio. We do\nthat to avoid context switching on libaio that would cause performance\nissues. You will find this thread on a thread dump with the prefix\nActiveMQ-AIO-writer-pool.\nClient-Side Thread Management\nOn the client side, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis maintains a single, \"global\"\nstatic scheduled thread pool and a single, \"global\" static general thread\npool for use by all clients using the same classloader in that JVM instance.\nThe static scheduled thread pool has a maximum size of 5 threads by\ndefault.  This can be changed using the scheduledThreadPoolMaxSize URI\nparameter.\nThe general purpose thread pool has an unbounded maximum size. This is\nchanged using the threadPoolMaxSize URL parameter.\nIf required Apache ActiveMQ Artemis can also be configured so that each\nClientSessionFactory instance does not use these \"global\" static pools but\ninstead maintains its own scheduled and general purpose pool. Any\nsessions created from that ClientSessionFactory will use those pools\ninstead. This is configured using the useGlobalPools boolean URL parameter.\n"},"logging.html":{"url":"logging.html","title":"Logging","keywords":"","body":"Logging\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis uses the JBoss Logging framework to do its logging and is\nconfigurable via the logging.properties file found in the\nconfiguration directories.

Since interactions are RESTful the\nHTTP uniform interface provides all the interoperability you need to\ncommunicate between different languages, platforms, and even\nmessaging implementations that choose to implement the same RESTful\ninterface as Apache ActiveMQ Artemis (i.e. the REST-*\neffort.)\n\nNo envelope (e.g. SOAP) or feed (e.g. Atom) format requirements. You\nshouldn't have to learn, use, or parse a specific XML document\nformat in order to send and receive messages through Apache ActiveMQ Artemis's REST\ninterface.\n\nLeverage the reliability, scalability, and clustering features of\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis on the back end without sacrificing the simplicity of a\nREST interface.\n\n\nInstallation and Configuration\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis's REST interface is installed as a Web archive (WAR). It depends on the RESTEasy project and can currently only run within a servlet container. Installing the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis REST interface is a little bit different depending whether Apache ActiveMQ Artemis is already embedded (e.g. you're deploying within Wildfly) or configured on the network somewhere, or you want the ActiveMQ Artemis REST WAR itself to startup and manage the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis server.\nInstalling Within Pre-configured Environment\nThis section should be used when you want to use the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis REST interface in an environment that already has Apache ActiveMQ Artemis installed and running. You must create a Web archive (.WAR) file with the following web.xml settings:\n\n   \n      \n         org.jboss.resteasy.plugins.server.servlet.ResteasyBootstrap\n      \n   \n\n   \n      \n         org.apache.activemq.artemis.rest.integration.RestMessagingBootstrapListener\n      \n   \n\n   \n      Rest-Messaging\n      \n         org.jboss.resteasy.plugins.server.servlet.FilterDispatcher\n      \n   \n\n   \n      Rest-Messaging\n      /*\n   \n\nWithin your WEB-INF/lib directory you must have the artemis-rest.jar file. If RESTEasy is not installed within your environment, you must add the RESTEasy jar files within the lib directory as well. Here's a sample Maven pom.xml that can build a WAR with the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis REST library.\n\n\n   4.0.0\n   org.somebody\n   artemis-rest\n   war\n   My App\n   1.0-SNAPSHOT\n\n   \n      \n         org.apache.activemq.rest\n         artemis-rest\n         $VERSION\n         \n            \n               *\n               *\n            \n         \n      \n   \n\nThe project structure should look this like:\n|-- pom.xml\n`-- src\n   `-- main\n       `-- webapp\n           `-- WEB-INF\n               `-- web.xml\nIt is worth noting that when deploying a WAR in a Java EE application server like Wildfly the URL for the resulting application will include the name of the WAR by default. For example, if you've constructed a WAR as described above named \"activemq-rest.war\" then clients will access it at, e.g. http://localhost:8080/activemq-rest/[queues|topics]. We'll see more about this later.\nBootstrapping ActiveMQ Artemis Along with REST\nYou can bootstrap Apache ActiveMQ Artemis within your WAR as well. To do this, you must have the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis core and JMS jars along with Netty, RESTEasy, and the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis REST jar within your WEB-INF/lib. You must also have a broker.xml config file within WEB-INF/classes. The examples that come with the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis REST distribution show how to do this. You must also add an additional listener to your web.xml file. Here's an example:\n\n   \n      \n         org.jboss.resteasy.plugins.server.servlet.ResteasyBootstrap\n      \n   \n\n   \n      \n         org.apache.activemq.artemis.rest.integration.ActiveMQBootstrapListener\n      \n   \n\n   \n      \n         org.apache.activemq.artemis.rest.integration.RestMessagingBootstrapListener\n      \n   \n\n   \n      Rest-Messaging\n      \n         org.jboss.resteasy.plugins.server.servlet.FilterDispatcher\n      \n   \n\n   \n      Rest-Messaging\n      /*\n   \n\nHere's a Maven pom.xml file for creating a WAR for this environment.

Default to \"vm://0\".\n\n\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis REST Interface Basics\nThe Apache ActiveMQ Artemis REST interface publishes a variety of REST resources to\nperform various tasks on a queue or topic. Only the top-level queue and\ntopic URI schemes are published to the outside world. You must discover\nall other resources to interact with by looking for and traversing links.\nYou'll find published links within custom response headers and embedded\nin published XML representations. Let's look at how this works.\nQueue and Topic Resources\nTo interact with a queue or topic you do a HEAD or GET request on the\nfollowing relative URI pattern:\n/queues/{name}\n/topics/{name}\nThe base of the URI is the base URL of the WAR you deployed the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis\nREST server within as defined in the Installation and\nConfiguration section of this document. Replace the {name}\nstring within the above URI pattern with the name of the queue or topic\nyou are interested in interacting with. Next, perform your HEAD or GET\nrequest on this URI. Here's what a request/response would look like.\nHEAD /queues/bar HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.com\n\n--- Response ---\nHTTP/1.1 200 Ok\nmsg-create: http://example.com/queues/bar/create\nmsg-create-with-id: http://example.com/queues/bar/create/{id}\nmsg-pull-consumers: http://example.com/queues/bar/pull-consumers\nmsg-push-consumers: http://example.com/queues/bar/push-consumers\n\nNote\nYou can use the \"curl\" utility to test this easily. Simply execute a\ncommand like this:\ncurl --head http://example.com/queues/bar\n\nThe HEAD or GET response contains a number of custom response headers\nthat are URLs to additional REST resources that allow you to interact\nwith the queue or topic in different ways. It is important not to rely\non the scheme of the URLs returned within these headers as they are an\nimplementation detail. Treat them as opaque and query for them each and\nevery time you initially interact (at boot time) with the server. If you\ntreat all URLs as opaque then you will be isolated from implementation\nchanges as the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis REST interface evolves over time.\nQueue Resource Response Headers\nBelow is a list of response headers you should expect when interacting\nwith a Queue resource.\n\nmsg-create. This is a URL you POST messages to. The semantics of\nthis link are described in Posting Messages.\n\nmsg-create-with-id. This is a URL template you can use to POST\nmessages. The semantics of this link are described in Posting\nMessages.\n\nmsg-pull-consumers. This is a URL for creating consumers that will\npull from a queue. The semantics of this link are described in\nConsuming Messages via Pull.\n\nmsg-push-consumers. This is a URL for registering other URLs you\nwant the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis REST server to push messages to. The semantics of\nthis link are described in Pushing Messages.\n\n\nTopic Resource Response Headers\nBelow is a list of response headers you should expect when interacting\nwith a Topic resource.\n\nmsg-create. This is a URL you POST messages to. The semantics of\nthis link are described in Posting Messages.\n\nmsg-create-with-id. This is a URL template you can use to POST\nmessages. The semantics of this link are described in Posting\nMessages.\n\nmsg-pull-subscriptions. This is a URL for creating subscribers\nthat will pull from a topic. The semantics of this link are\ndescribed in Consuming Messages via Pull.\n\nmsg-push-subscriptions. This is a URL for registering other URLs\nyou want the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis REST server to push messages to. The semantics\nof this link are described in Pushing Messages.\n\n\nPosting Messages\nThis chapter discusses the protocol for posting messages to a queue or a\ntopic. In Apache ActiveMQ Artemis REST Interface Basics, you saw that a\nqueue or topic resource publishes variable custom headers that are links\nto other RESTful resources. The msg-create header is a URL you can\npost a message to. Messages are published to a queue or topic by sending\na simple HTTP message to the URL published by the msg-create header.\nThe HTTP message contains whatever content you want to publish to the\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis destination. Here's an example scenario:\n\nNote\nYou can also post messages to the URL template found in\nmsg-create-with-id, but this is a more advanced use-case involving\nduplicate detection that we will discuss later in this section.\n\n\nObtain the starting msg-create header from the queue or topic\nresource.\nHEAD /queues/bar HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.com\n\n--- Response ---\nHTTP/1.1 200 Ok\nmsg-create: http://example.com/queues/bar/create\nmsg-create-with-id: http://example.com/queues/bar/create/{id}\n\nDo a POST to the URL contained in the msg-create header.\nPOST /queues/bar/create\nHost: example.com\nContent-Type: application/xml\n\n\n   Bill\n   iPhone4\n   $199.99\n\n\n--- Response ---\nHTTP/1.1 201 Created\nmsg-create-next: http://example.com/queues/bar/create\n\nNote\nYou can use the \"curl\" utility to test this easily. Simply execute\na command like this:\ncurl --verbose --data \"123\" http://example.com/queues/bar/create\n\nA successful response will return a 201 response code. Also notice\nthat a msg-create-next response header is sent as well. You must\nuse this URL to POST your next message.\n\nPOST your next message to the queue using the URL returned in the\nmsg-create-next header.\nPOST /queues/bar/create\nHost: example.com\nContent-Type: application/xml\n\n\n   Monica\n   iPad\n   $499.99\n\n\n--- Response --\nHTTP/1.1 201 Created\nmsg-create-next: http://example.com/queues/bar/create\nContinue using the new msg-create-next header returned with each\nresponse.\n\n\n\nWarning\nIt is VERY IMPORTANT that you never re-use returned\nmsg-create-next headers to post new messages. If the dups-ok\nconfiguration property is set to false on the server then this URL\nwill be uniquely generated for each message and used for duplicate\ndetection. If you lose the URL within the msg-create-next header,\nthen just go back to the queue or topic resource to get the\nmsg-create URL again.\n\nDuplicate Detection\nSometimes you might have network problems when posting new messages to a\nqueue or topic. You may do a POST and never receive a response.\nUnfortunately, you don't know whether or not the server received the\nmessage and so a re-post of the message might cause duplicates to be\nposted to the queue or topic. By default, the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis REST interface is\nconfigured to accept and post duplicate messages. You can change this by\nturning on duplicate message detection by setting the dups-ok config\noption to false as described in Apache ActiveMQ Artemis REST Interface\nBasics. When you do this, the initial POST to the msg-create\nURL will redirect you, using the standard HTTP 307 redirection mechanism\nto a unique URL to POST to. All other interactions remain the same as\ndiscussed earlier. Here's an example:\n\nObtain the starting msg-create header from the queue or topic\nresource.\nHEAD /queues/bar HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.com\n\n--- Response ---\nHTTP/1.1 200 Ok\nmsg-create: http://example.com/queues/bar/create\nmsg-create-with-id: http://example.com/queues/bar/create/{id}\n\nDo a POST to the URL contained in the msg-create header.\nPOST /queues/bar/create\nHost: example.com\nContent-Type: application/xml\n\n\n   Bill\n   iPhone4\n   $199.99\n\n\n--- Response ---\nHTTP/1.1 307 Redirect\nLocation: http://example.com/queues/bar/create/13582001787372\nA successful response will return a 307 response code. This is\nstandard HTTP protocol. It is telling you that you must re-POST to\nthe URL contained within the Location header.\n\nre-POST your message to the URL provided within the Location\nheader.\nPOST /queues/bar/create/13582001787372\nHost: example.com\nContent-Type: application/xml\n\n\n   Bill\n   iPhone4\n   $199.99\n\n\n--- Response --\nHTTP/1.1 201 Created\nmsg-create-next: http://example.com/queues/bar/create/13582001787373\nYou should receive a 201 Created response. If there is a network\nfailure, just re-POST to the Location header. For new messages, use\nthe returned msg-create-next header returned with each response.\n\nPOST any new message to the returned msg-create-next header.\nPOST /queues/bar/create/13582001787373\nHost: example.com\nContent-Type: application/xml\n\n\n   Monica\n   iPad\n   $499.99\n\n\n--- Response --\nHTTP/1.1 201 Created\nmsg-create-next: http://example.com/queues/bar/create/13582001787374\nIf there ever is a network problem, just repost to the URL provided\nin the msg-create-next header.\n\n\nHow can this work? As you can see, with each successful response, the\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis REST server returns a uniquely generated URL within the\nmsg-create-next header. This URL is dedicated to the next new message\nyou want to post. Behind the scenes, the code extracts an identify from\nthe URL and uses Apache ActiveMQ Artemis's duplicate detection mechanism by setting the\nDUPLICATE_DETECTION_ID property of the JMS message that is actually\nposted to the system.\nIf you happen to use the same ID more than once you'll see a message\nlike this on the server:\nWARN  [org.apache.activemq.artemis.core.server] (Thread-3 (Apache ActiveMQ Artemis-remoting-threads-ActiveMQServerImpl::serverUUID=8d6be6f8-5e8b-11e2-80db-51bbde66f473-26319292-267207)) AMQ112098: Duplicate message detected - message will not be routed. Message information:\nServerMessage[messageID=20,priority=4, bodySize=1500,expiration=0, durable=true, address=bar,properties=TypedProperties[{http_content$type=application/x-www-form-urlencoded, http_content$length=3, postedAsHttpMessage=true, _AMQ_DUPL_ID=42}]]@12835058\nAn alternative to this approach is to use the msg-create-with-id\nheader. This is not an invokable URL, but a URL template. The idea is\nthat the client provides the DUPLICATE_DETECTION_ID and creates its\nown create-next URL. The msg-create-with-id header looks like this\n(you've see it in previous examples, but we haven't used it):\nmsg-create-with-id: http://example.com/queues/bar/create/{id}\nYou see that it is a regular URL appended with a {id}. This {id} is\na pattern matching substring. A client would generate its\nDUPLICATE_DETECTION_ID and replace {id} with that generated id, then\nPOST to the new URL. The URL the client creates works exactly like a\ncreate-next URL described earlier. The response of this POST would\nalso return a new msg-create-next header. The client can continue to\ngenerate its own DUPLICATE_DETECTION_ID, or use the new URL returned\nvia the msg-create-next header.\nThe advantage of this approach is that the client does not have to\nrepost the message. It also only has to come up with a unique\nDUPLICATE_DETECTION_ID once.\nPersistent Messages\nBy default, posted messages are not durable and will not be persisted in\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis's journal. You can create durable messages by modifying the\ndefault configuration as expressed in Chapter 2 so that all messages are\npersisted when sent. Alternatively, you can set a URL query parameter\ncalled durable to true when you post your messages to the URLs\nreturned in the msg-create, msg-create-with-id, or msg-create-next\nheaders. here's an example of that.\nPOST /queues/bar/create?durable=true\nHost: example.com\nContent-Type: application/xml\n\n\n   Bill\n   iPhone4\n   $199.99\n\nTTL, Expiration and Priority\nYou can set the time to live, expiration, and/or the priority of the\nmessage in the queue or topic by setting an additional query parameter.\nThe expiration query parameter is a long specifying the time in\nmilliseconds since epoch (a long date). The ttl query parameter is a\ntime in milliseconds you want the message active. The priority is\nanother query parameter with an integer value between 0 and 9 expressing\nthe priority of the message. i.e.:\nPOST /queues/bar/create?expiration=30000&priority=3\nHost: example.com\nContent-Type: application/xml\n\n\n   Bill\n   iPhone4\n   $199.99\n\nConsuming Messages via Pull\nThere are two different ways to consume messages from a topic or queue.\nYou can wait and have the messaging server push them to you, or you can\ncontinuously poll the server yourself to see if messages are available.\nThis chapter discusses the latter. Consuming messages via a pull works\nalmost identically for queues and topics with some minor, but important\ncaveats. To start consuming you must create a consumer resource on the\nserver that is dedicated to your client. Now, this pretty much breaks\nthe stateless principle of REST, but after much prototyping, this is the\nbest way to work most effectively with Apache ActiveMQ Artemis through a REST\ninterface.\nYou create consumer resources by doing a simple POST to the URL\npublished by the msg-pull-consumers response header if you are\ninteracting with a queue, the msg-pull-subscribers response header if\nyou're interacting with a topic. These headers are provided by the main\nqueue or topic resource discussed in Apache ActiveMQ Artemis REST Interface\nBasics. Doing an empty POST to one of these URLs will create a\nconsumer resource that follows an auto-acknowledge protocol and, if you\nare interacting with a topic, creates a temporarily subscription to the\ntopic. If you want to use the acknowledgement protocol and/or create a\ndurable subscription (topics only), then you must use the form\nparameters (application/x-www-form-urlencoded) described below.\n\nautoAck. A value of true or false can be given. This defaults\nto true if you do not pass this parameter.\n\ndurable. A value of true or false can be given. This defaults\nto false if you do not pass this parameter. Only available on\ntopics. This specifies whether you want a durable subscription or\nnot. A durable subscription persists through server restart.\n\nname. This is the name of the durable subscription. If you do not\nprovide this parameter, the name will be automatically generated by\nthe server. Only usable on topics.\n\nselector. This is an optional JMS selector string. The Apache ActiveMQ Artemis\nREST interface adds HTTP headers to the JMS message for REST\nproduced messages. HTTP headers are prefixed with \"http_\" and every\n'-' character is converted to a '$'.\n\nidle-timeout. For a topic subscription, idle time in milliseconds\nin which the consumer connections will be closed if idle.\n\ndelete-when-idle. Boolean value, If true, a topic subscription\nwill be deleted (even if it is durable) when the idle timeout is\nreached.\n\n\n\nNote\nIf you have multiple pull-consumers active at the same time on the\nsame destination be aware that unless the consumer-window-size is 0\nthen one consumer might buffer messages while the other consumer gets\nnone.\n\nAuto-Acknowledge\nThis section focuses on the auto-acknowledge protocol for consuming\nmessages via a pull. Here's a list of the response headers and URLs\nyou'll be interested in.\n\nmsg-pull-consumers. The URL of a factory resource for creating\nqueue consumer resources. You will pull from these created\nresources.\n\nmsg-pull-subscriptions. The URL of a factory resource for creating\ntopic subscription resources. You will pull from the created\nresources.\n\nmsg-consume-next. The URL you will pull the next message from.\nThis is returned with every response.\n\nmsg-consumer. This is a URL pointing back to the consumer or\nsubscription resource created for the client.\n\n\nCreating an Auto-Ack Consumer or Subscription\nHere is an example of creating an auto-acknowledged queue pull consumer.\n\nFind the pull-consumers URL by doing a HEAD or GET request to the\nbase queue resource.\nHEAD /queues/bar HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.com\n\n--- Response ---\nHTTP/1.1 200 Ok\nmsg-create: http://example.com/queues/bar/create\nmsg-pull-consumers: http://example.com/queues/bar/pull-consumers\nmsg-push-consumers: http://example.com/queues/bar/push-consumers\n\nNext do an empty POST to the URL returned in the\nmsg-pull-consumers header.\nPOST /queues/bar/pull-consumers HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.com\n\n--- response ---\nHTTP/1.1 201 Created\nLocation: http://example.com/queues/bar/pull-consumers/auto-ack/333\nmsg-consume-next: http://example.com/queues/bar/pull-consumers/auto-ack/333/consume-next-1\nThe Location header points to the JMS consumer resource that was\ncreated on the server. It is good to remember this URL, although, as\nyou'll see later, it is transmitted with each response just to\nremind you.\n\n\nCreating an auto-acknowledged consumer for a topic is pretty much the\nsame. Here's an example of creating a durable auto-acknowledged topic\npull subscription.\n\nFind the pull-subscriptions URL by doing a HEAD or GET request to\nthe base topic resource\nHEAD /topics/bar HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.com\n\n--- Response ---\nHTTP/1.1 200 Ok\nmsg-create: http://example.com/topics/foo/create\nmsg-pull-subscriptions: http://example.com/topics/foo/pull-subscriptions\nmsg-push-subscriptions: http://example.com/topics/foo/push-subscriptions\n\nNext do a POST to the URL returned in the msg-pull-subscriptions\nheader passing in a true value for the durable form parameter.\nPOST /topics/foo/pull-subscriptions HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.com\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n\ndurable=true\n\n--- Response ---\nHTTP/1.1 201 Created\nLocation: http://example.com/topics/foo/pull-subscriptions/auto-ack/222\nmsg-consume-next:\nhttp://example.com/topics/foo/pull-subscriptions/auto-ack/222/consume-next-1\nThe Location header points to the JMS subscription resource that\nwas created on the server. It is good to remember this URL,\nalthough, as you'll see later, it is transmitted with each response\njust to remind you.\n\n\nConsuming Messages\nAfter you have created a consumer resource, you are ready to start\npulling messages from the server. Notice that when you created the\nconsumer for either the queue or topic, the response contained a\nmsg-consume-next response header. POST to the URL contained within\nthis header to consume the next message in the queue or topic\nsubscription. A successful POST causes the server to extract a message\nfrom the queue or topic subscription, acknowledge it, and return it to\nthe consuming client. If there are no messages in the queue or topic\nsubscription, a 503 (Service Unavailable) HTTP code is returned.\n\nWarning\nFor both successful and unsuccessful posts to the msg-consume-next\nURL, the response will contain a new msg-consume-next header. You must\nALWAYS use this new URL returned within the new msg-consume-next\nheader to consume new messages.\n\nHere's an example of pulling multiple messages from the consumer\nresource.\n\nDo a POST on the msg-consume-next URL that was returned with the\nconsumer or subscription resource discussed earlier.\nPOST /queues/bar/pull-consumers/consume-next-1\nHost: example.com\n\n--- Response ---\nHTTP/1.1 200 Ok\nContent-Type: application/xml\nmsg-consume-next: http://example.com/queues/bar/pull-consumers/333/consume-next-2\nmsg-consumer: http://example.com/queues/bar/pull-consumers/333\n\n...\nThe POST returns the message consumed from the queue. It also\nreturns a new msg-consume-next link. Use this new link to get the\nnext message. Notice also a msg-consumer response header is\nreturned. This is a URL that points back to the consumer or\nsubscription resource. You will need that to clean up your\nconnection after you are finished using the queue or topic.\n\nThe POST returns the message consumed from the queue. It also\nreturns a new msg-consume-next link. Use this new link to get the\nnext message.\nPOST /queues/bar/pull-consumers/consume-next-2\nHost: example.com\n\n--- Response ---\nHttp/1.1 503 Service Unavailable\nRetry-After: 5\nmsg-consume-next: http://example.com/queues/bar/pull-consumers/333/consume-next-2\nIn this case, there are no messages in the queue, so we get a 503\nresponse back. As per the HTTP 1.1 spec, a 503 response may return a\nRetry-After head specifying the time in seconds that you should\nretry a post. Also notice, that another new msg-consume-next URL is\npresent. Although it probably is the same URL you used last post,\nget in the habit of using URLs returned in response headers as\nfuture versions of Apache ActiveMQ Artemis REST might be redirecting you or adding\nadditional data to the URL after timeouts like this.\n\nPOST to the URL within the last msg-consume-next to get the next\nmessage.\nPOST /queues/bar/pull-consumers/consume-next-2\nHost: example.com\n\n--- Response ---\nHTTP/1.1 200 Ok\nContent-Type: application/xml\nmsg-consume-next: http://example.com/queues/bar/pull-consumers/333/consume-next-3\n\n...\n\n\nRecovering From Network Failures\nIf you experience a network failure and do not know if your post to a\nmsg-consume-next URL was successful or not, just re-do your POST. A POST\nto a msg-consume-next URL is idempotent, meaning that it will return the\nsame result if you execute on any one msg-consume-next URL more than\nonce. Behind the scenes, the consumer resource caches the last consumed\nmessage so that if there is a message failure and you do a re-post, the\ncached last message will be returned (along with a new msg-consume-next\nURL). This is the reason why the protocol always requires you to use the\nnext new msg-consume-next URL returned with each response. Information\nabout what state the client is in is embedded within the actual URL.\nRecovering From Client or Server Crashes\nIf the server crashes and you do a POST to the msg-consume-next URL, the\nserver will return a 412 (Preconditions Failed) response code. This is\ntelling you that the URL you are using is out of sync with the server.\nThe response will contain a new msg-consume-next header to invoke on.\nIf the client crashes there are multiple ways you can recover. If you\nhave remembered the last msg-consume-next link, you can just re-POST to\nit. If you have remembered the consumer resource URL, you can do a GET\nor HEAD request to obtain a new msg-consume-next URL. If you have\ncreated a topic subscription using the name parameter discussed earlier,\nyou can re-create the consumer. Re-creation will return a\nmsg-consume-next URL you can use. If you cannot do any of these things,\nyou will have to create a new consumer.\nThe problem with the auto-acknowledge protocol is that if the client or\nserver crashes, it is possible for you to skip messages. The scenario\nwould happen if the server crashes after auto-acknowledging a message\nand before the client receives the message. If you want more reliable\nmessaging, then you must use the acknowledgement protocol.\nManual Acknowledgement\nThe manual acknowledgement protocol is similar to the auto-ack protocol\nexcept there is an additional round trip to the server to tell it that\nyou have received the message and that the server can internally ack the\nmessage. Here is a list of the response headers you will be interested\nin.\n\nmsg-pull-consumers. The URL of a factory resource for creating\nqueue consumer resources. You will pull from these created resources\n\nmsg-pull-subscriptions. The URL of a factory resource for creating\ntopic subscription resources. You will pull from the created\nresources.\n\nmsg-acknowledge-next. URL used to obtain the next message in the\nqueue or topic subscription. It does not acknowledge the message\nthough.\n\nmsg-acknowledgement. URL used to acknowledge a message.\n\nmsg-consumer. This is a URL pointing back to the consumer or\nsubscription resource created for the client.\n\n\nCreating manually-acknowledged consumers or subscriptions\nHere is an example of creating an auto-acknowledged queue pull consumer.\n\nFind the pull-consumers URL by doing a HEAD or GET request to the\nbase queue resource.\nHEAD /queues/bar HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.com\n\n--- Response ---\nHTTP/1.1 200 Ok\nmsg-create: http://example.com/queues/bar/create\nmsg-pull-consumers: http://example.com/queues/bar/pull-consumers\nmsg-push-consumers: http://example.com/queues/bar/push-consumers\n\nNext do a POST to the URL returned in the msg-pull-consumers\nheader passing in a false value to the autoAck form parameter .\nPOST /queues/bar/pull-consumers HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.com\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n\nautoAck=false\n\n--- response ---\nHTTP/1.1 201 Created\nLocation: http://example.com/queues/bar/pull-consumers/acknowledged/333\nmsg-acknowledge-next: http://example.com/queues/bar/pull-consumers/acknowledged/333/acknowledge-next-1\nThe Location header points to the JMS consumer resource that was\ncreated on the server. It is good to remember this URL, although, as\nyou'll see later, it is transmitted with each response just to\nremind you.\n\n\nCreating a manually-acknowledged consumer for a topic is pretty much\nthe same. Here's an example of creating a durable manually-acknowledged\ntopic pull subscription.\n\nFind the pull-subscriptions URL by doing a HEAD or GET request to\nthe base topic resource\nHEAD /topics/bar HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.com\n\n--- Response ---\nHTTP/1.1 200 Ok\nmsg-create: http://example.com/topics/foo/create\nmsg-pull-subscriptions: http://example.com/topics/foo/pull-subscriptions\nmsg-push-subscriptions: http://example.com/topics/foo/push-subscriptions\n\nNext do a POST to the URL returned in the msg-pull-subscriptions\nheader passing in a true value for the durable form parameter\nand a false value to the autoAck form parameter.\nPOST /topics/foo/pull-subscriptions HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.com\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n\ndurable=true&autoAck=false\n\n--- Response ---\nHTTP/1.1 201 Created\nLocation: http://example.com/topics/foo/pull-subscriptions/acknowledged/222\nmsg-acknowledge-next:\nhttp://example.com/topics/foo/pull-subscriptions/acknowledged/222/consume-next-1\nThe Location header points to the JMS subscription resource that\nwas created on the server. It is good to remember this URL,\nalthough, as you'll see later, it is transmitted with each response\njust to remind you.\n\n\nConsuming and Acknowledging a Message\nAfter you have created a consumer resource, you are ready to start\npulling messages from the server. Notice that when you created the\nconsumer for either the queue or topic, the response contained a\nmsg-acknowledge-next response header. POST to the URL contained within\nthis header to consume the next message in the queue or topic\nsubscription. If there are no messages in the queue or topic\nsubscription, a 503 (Service Unavailable) HTTP code is returned. A\nsuccessful POST causes the server to extract a message from the queue or\ntopic subscription and return it to the consuming client. It does not\nacknowledge the message though. The response will contain the\nacknowledgement header which you will use to acknowledge the message.\nHere's an example of pulling multiple messages from the consumer\nresource.\n\nDo a POST on the msg-acknowledge-next URL that was returned with the\nconsumer or subscription resource discussed earlier.\nPOST /queues/bar/pull-consumers/consume-next-1\nHost: example.com\n\n--- Response ---\nHTTP/1.1 200 Ok\nContent-Type: application/xml\nmsg-acknowledgement:\nhttp://example.com/queues/bar/pull-consumers/333/acknowledgement/2\nmsg-consumer: http://example.com/queues/bar/pull-consumers/333\n\n...\nThe POST returns the message consumed from the queue. It also\nreturns amsg-acknowledgement link. You will use this new link to\nacknowledge the message. Notice also a msg-consumer response\nheader is returned. This is a URL that points back to the consumer\nor subscription resource. You will need that to clean up your\nconnection after you are finished using the queue or topic.\n\nAcknowledge or unacknowledge the message by doing a POST to the URL\ncontained in the msg-acknowledgement header. You must pass an\nacknowledge form parameter set to true or false depending on\nwhether you want to acknowledge or unacknowledge the message on the\nserver.\nPOST /queues/bar/pull-consumers/acknowledgement/2\nHost: example.com\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n\nacknowledge=true\n\n--- Response ---\nHttp/1.1 204 Ok\nmsg-acknowledge-next:\nhttp://example.com/queues/bar/pull-consumers/333/acknowledge-next-2\nWhether you acknowledge or unacknowledge the message, the response\nwill contain a new msg-acknowledge-next header that you must use to\nobtain the next message.\n\n\nRecovering From Network Failures\nIf you experience a network failure and do not know if your post to a\nmsg-acknowledge-next or msg-acknowledgement URL was successful or\nnot, just re-do your POST. A POST to one of these URLs is idempotent,\nmeaning that it will return the same result if you re-post. Behind the\nscenes, the consumer resource keeps track of its current state. If the\nlast action was a call tomsg-acknowledge-next, it will have the last\nmessage cached, so that if a re-post is done, it will return the message\nagain. Same goes with re-posting to msg-acknowledgement. The server\nremembers its last state and will return the same results. If you look\nat the URLs you'll see that they contain information about the expected\ncurrent state of the server. This is how the server knows what the\nclient is expecting.\nRecovering From Client or Server Crashes\nIf the server crashes and while you are doing a POST to the\nmsg-acknowledge-next URL, just re-post. Everything should reconnect\nall right. On the other hand, if the server crashes while you are doing\na POST tomsg-acknowledgement, the server will return a 412\n(Preconditions Failed) response code. This is telling you that the URL\nyou are using is out of sync with the server and the message you are\nacknowledging was probably re-enqueued. The response will contain a new\nmsg-acknowledge-next header to invoke on.\nAs long as you have \"bookmarked\" the consumer resource URL (returned\nfrom Location header on a create, or the msg-consumer header), you\ncan recover from client crashes by doing a GET or HEAD request on the\nconsumer resource to obtain what state you are in. If the consumer\nresource is expecting you to acknowledge a message, it will return a\nmsg-acknowledgement header in the response. If the consumer resource\nis expecting you to pull for the next message, the\nmsg-acknowledge-next header will be in the response. With manual\nacknowledgement you are pretty much guaranteed to avoid skipped\nmessages. For topic subscriptions that were created with a name\nparameter, you do not have to \"bookmark\" the returned URL. Instead, you\ncan re-create the consumer resource with the same exact name. The\nresponse will contain the same information as if you did a GET or HEAD\nrequest on the consumer resource.\nBlocking Pulls with Accept-Wait\nUnless your queue or topic has a high rate of message flowing though it,\nif you use the pull protocol, you're going to be receiving a lot of 503\nresponses as you continuously pull the server for new messages. To\nalleviate this problem, the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis REST interface provides the\nAccept-Wait header. This is a generic HTTP request header that is a\nhint to the server for how long the client is willing to wait for a\nresponse from the server. The value of this header is the time in\nseconds the client is willing to block for. You would send this request\nheader with your pull requests. Here's an example:\nPOST /queues/bar/pull-consumers/consume-next-2\nHost: example.com\nAccept-Wait: 30\n\n--- Response ---\nHTTP/1.1 200 Ok\nContent-Type: application/xml\nmsg-consume-next: http://example.com/queues/bar/pull-consumers/333/consume-next-3\n\n...\nIn this example, we're posting to a msg-consume-next URL and telling the\nserver that we would be willing to block for 30 seconds.\nClean Up Your Consumers!\nWhen the client is done with its consumer or topic subscription it\nshould do an HTTP DELETE call on the consumer URL passed back from the\nLocation header or the msg-consumer response header. The server will\ntime out a consumer with the value of consumer-session-timeout-seconds\nconfigured from REST configuration, so you don't have\nto clean up if you don't want to, but if you are a good kid, you will\nclean up your messes. A consumer timeout for durable subscriptions will\nnot delete the underlying durable JMS subscription though, only the\nserver-side consumer resource (and underlying JMS session).\nPushing Messages\nYou can configure the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis REST server to push messages to a\nregistered URL either remotely through the REST interface, or by\ncreating a pre-configured XML file for the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis REST server to load\nat boot time.\nThe Queue Push Subscription XML\nCreating a push consumer for a queue first involves creating a very\nsimple XML document. This document tells the server if the push\nsubscription should survive server reboots (is it durable). It must\nprovide a URL to ship the forwarded message to. Finally, you have to\nprovide authentication information if the final endpoint requires\nauthentication. Here's a simple example:\n\n   false\n    1\n   ]]>\n   \n   \n   5\n   1000\n   true\n\nThe durable element specifies whether the registration should be saved\nto disk so that if there is a server restart, the push subscription will\nstill work. This element is not required. If left out it defaults\ntofalse. If durable is set to true, an XML file for the push\nsubscription will be created within the directory specified by the\nqueue-push-store-dir config variable defined in Chapter 2\n(topic-push-store-dir for topics).\nThe selector element is optional and defines a JMS message selector.\nYou should enclose it within CDATA blocks as some of the selector\ncharacters are illegal XML.\nThe maxRetries element specifies how many times a the server will try\nto push a message to a URL if there is a connection failure.\nThe retryWaitMillis element specifies how long to wait before\nperforming a retry.\nThe disableOnFailure element, if set to true, will disable the\nregistration if all retries have failed. It will not disable the\nconnection on non-connection-failure issues (like a bad request for\ninstance). In these cases, the dead letter queue logic of Apache ActiveMQ Artemis will\ntake over.\nThe link element specifies the basis of the interaction. The href\nattribute contains the URL you want to interact with. It is the only\nrequired attribute. The type attribute specifies the content-type of\nwhat the push URL is expecting. The method attribute defines what HTTP\nmethod the server will use when it sends the message to the server. If\nit is not provided it defaults to POST. The rel attribute is very\nimportant and the value of it triggers different behavior. Here's the\nvalues a rel attribute can have:\n\ndestination. The href URL is assumed to be a queue or topic\nresource of another Apache ActiveMQ Artemis REST server. The push registration will\ninitially do a HEAD request to this URL to obtain a\nmsg-create-with-id header. It will use this header to push new\nmessages to the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis REST endpoint reliably. Here's an example:\n\n   \n\n\ntemplate. In this case, the server is expecting the link element's\nhref attribute to be a URL expression. The URL expression must have\none and only one URL parameter within it. The server will use a\nunique value to create the endpoint URL. Here's an example:\n\n   \n\nIn this example, the {id} sub-string is the one and only one URL\nparameter.\n\nuser defined. If the rel attributes is not destination or template\n(or is empty or missing), then the server will send an HTTP message\nto the href URL using the HTTP method defined in the method\nattribute. Here's an example:\n\n   \n\n\n\nThe Topic Push Subscription XML\nThe push XML for a topic is the same except the root element is\npush-topic-registration. (Also remember the selector element is\noptional). The rest of the document is the same. Here's an example of a\ntemplate registration:\n\n   true\n    1\n   ]]>\n   \n   \n\nCreating a Push Subscription at Runtime\nCreating a push subscription at runtime involves getting the factory\nresource URL from the msg-push-consumers header, if the destination is a\nqueue, or msg-push-subscriptions header, if the destination is a topic.\nHere's an example of creating a push registration for a queue:\n\nFirst do a HEAD request to the queue resource:\nHEAD /queues/bar HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.com\n\n--- Response ---\nHTTP/1.1 200 Ok\nmsg-create: http://example.com/queues/bar/create\nmsg-pull-consumers: http://example.com/queues/bar/pull-consumers\nmsg-push-consumers: http://example.com/queues/bar/push-consumers\n\nNext POST your subscription XML to the URL returned from\nmsg-push-consumers header\nPOST /queues/bar/push-consumers\nHost: example.com\nContent-Type: application/xml\n\n\n   \n\n\n--- Response ---\nHTTP/1.1 201 Created\nLocation: http://example.com/queues/bar/push-consumers/1-333-1212\nThe Location header contains the URL for the created resource. If\nyou want to unregister this, then do a HTTP DELETE on this URL.\n\n\nHere's an example of creating a push registration for a topic:\n\nFirst do a HEAD request to the topic resource:\nHEAD /topics/bar HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.com\n\n--- Response ---\nHTTP/1.1 200 Ok\nmsg-create: http://example.com/topics/bar/create\nmsg-pull-subscriptions: http://example.com/topics/bar/pull-subscriptions\nmsg-push-subscriptions: http://example.com/topics/bar/push-subscriptions\n\nNext POST your subscription XML to the URL returned from\nmsg-push-subscriptions header\nPOST /topics/bar/push-subscriptions\nHost: example.com\nContent-Type: application/xml\n\n\n   \n\n\n--- Response ---\nHTTP/1.1 201 Created\nLocation: http://example.com/topics/bar/push-subscriptions/1-333-1212\nThe Location header contains the URL for the created resource. If\nyou want to unregister this, then do a HTTP DELETE on this URL.\n\n\nCreating a Push Subscription by Hand\nYou can create a push XML file yourself if you do not want to go through\nthe REST interface to create a push subscription. There is some\nadditional information you need to provide though. First, in the root\nelement, you must define a unique id attribute. You must also define a\ndestination element to specify the queue you should register a consumer\nwith. For a topic, the destination element is the name of the\nsubscription that will be created. For a topic, you must also specify\nthe topic name within the topic element.\nHere's an example of a hand-created queue registration. This file must\ngo in the directory specified by the queue-push-store-dir config\nvariable defined in Chapter 2:\n\n   bar\n   true\n   \n\nHere's an example of a hand-created topic registration. This file must\ngo in the directory specified by the topic-push-store-dir config\nvariable defined in Chapter 2:\n\n   my-subscription-1true\n   \n   foo\n\nPushing to Authenticated Servers\nPush subscriptions only support BASIC and DIGEST authentication out of\nthe box. Here is an example of adding BASIC authentication:\n\n   true\n   \n   \n      \n         guest\n         geheim\n      \n   \n\nFor DIGEST, just replace basic-auth with digest-auth.\nFor other authentication mechanisms, you can register headers you want\ntransmitted with each request. Use the header element with the name\nattribute representing the name of the header. Here's what custom\nheaders might look like:\n\n   true\n   \n   jfdiwe3321\n\nCreating Destinations\nYou can create a durable queue or topic through the REST interface.\nCurrently you cannot create a temporary queue or topic. To create a\nqueue you do a POST to the relative URL /queues with an XML\nrepresentation of the queue. For example:\nPOST /queues\nHost: example.com\nContent-Type: application/activemq.xml\n\n\n   true\n\n\n--- Response ---\nHTTP/1.1 201 Created\nLocation: http://example.com/queues/testQueue\nNotice that the Content-Type is application/activemq.xml.\nHere's what creating a topic would look like:\nPOST /topics\nHost: example.com\nContent-Type: application/activemq.xml\n\n\n\n\n--- Response ---\nHTTP/1.1 201 Created\nLocation: http://example.com/topics/testTopic\nSecuring the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis REST Interface\nWithin Wildfly Application server\nSecuring the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis REST interface is very simple with the Wildfly\nApplication Server. You turn on authentication for all URLs within your\nWAR's web.xml, and let the user Principal to propagate to Apache ActiveMQ Artemis. This\nonly works if you are using the JAASSecurityManager with Apache ActiveMQ Artemis. See\nthe Apache ActiveMQ Artemis documentation for more details.\nSecurity in other environments\nTo secure the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis REST interface in other environments you must\nrole your own security by specifying security constraints with your\nweb.xml for every path of every queue and topic you have deployed. Here\nis a list of URI patterns:\n\n\n\nPost\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n /queues\nsecure the POST operation to secure queue creation\n\n\n /queues/{queue-name}/create/\nsecure this URL pattern for producing messages.\n\n\n /queues/{queue-name}/pull-consumers/\nsecure this URL pattern for pushing messages.\n\n\n /queues/{queue-name}/push-consumers/\nsecure the POST operation to secure topic creation\n\n\n /topics\nsecure the POST operation to secure topic creation\n\n\n /topics/{topic-name}\nsecure the GET HEAD operation to getting information about the topic.\n\n\n /topics/{topic-name}/create/\nsecure this URL pattern for producing messages\n\n\n /topics/{topic-name}/pull-subscriptions/\nsecure this URL pattern for pulling messages\n\n\n /topics/{topic-name}/push-subscriptions/\nsecure this URL pattern for pushing messages\n\n\n\nMixing JMS and REST\nThe Apache ActiveMQ Artemis REST interface supports mixing JMS and REST producers and\nconsumers. You can send an ObjectMessage through a JMS Producer, and\nhave a REST client consume it. You can have a REST client POST a message\nto a topic and have a JMS Consumer receive it. Some simple\ntransformations are supported if you have the correct RESTEasy providers\ninstalled.\nJMS Producers - REST Consumers\nIf you have a JMS producer, the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis REST interface only supports\nObjectMessage type. If the JMS producer is aware that there may be REST\nconsumers, it should set a JMS property to specify what Content-Type the\nJava object should be translated into by REST clients. The Apache ActiveMQ Artemis REST\nserver will use RESTEasy content handlers (MessageBodyReader/Writers) to\ntransform the Java object to the type desired. Here's an example of a\nJMS producer setting the content type of the message.\nObjectMessage message = session.createObjectMessage();\nmessage.setStringProperty(org.apache.activemq.rest.HttpHeaderProperty.CONTENT_TYPE, \"application/xml\");\nIf the JMS producer does not set the content-type, then this information\nmust be obtained from the REST consumer. If it is a pull consumer, then\nthe REST client should send an Accept header with the desired media\ntypes it wants to convert the Java object into. If the REST client is a\npush registration, then the type attribute of the link element of the\npush registration should be set to the desired type.\nREST Producers - JMS Consumers\nIf you have a REST client producing messages and a JMS consumer,\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis REST has a simple helper class for you to transform the HTTP\nbody to a Java object. Here's some example code:\npublic void onMessage(Message message)\n{\n   MyType obj = org.apache.activemq.rest.Jms.getEntity(message, MyType.class);\n}\n\nThe way the getEntity() method works is that if the message is an\nObjectMessage, it will try to extract the desired type from it like any\nother JMS message. If a REST producer sent the message, then the method\nuses RESTEasy to convert the HTTP body to the Java object you want. See\nthe Javadoc of this class for more helper methods.\n"},"embedding-activemq.html":{"url":"embedding-activemq.html","title":"Embedding Apache ActiveMQ Artemis","keywords":"","body":"Embedding Apache ActiveMQ Artemis\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis is designed as set of simple Plain Old Java Objects (POJOs).\nThis means Apache ActiveMQ Artemis can be instantiated and run in any dependency\ninjection framework such as Spring or Google Guice.

Incoming and outgoing interceptors are be called for\nany packet entering or exiting the server respectively. This allows\ncustom code to be executed, e.g. for auditing packets, filtering or\nother reasons. Interceptors can change the packets they intercept. This\nmakes interceptors powerful, but also potentially dangerous.\nImplementing The Interceptors\nAll interceptors are protocol specific.\nAn interceptor for the core protocol must implement the interface Interceptor:\npackage org.apache.activemq.artemis.api.core.interceptor;\n\npublic interface Interceptor\n{\n   boolean intercept(Packet packet, RemotingConnection connection) throws ActiveMQException;\n}\n\nFor stomp protocol an interceptor must implement the interface StompFrameInterceptor:\npackage org.apache.activemq.artemis.core.protocol.stomp;\n\npublic interface StompFrameInterceptor extends BaseInterceptor\n{\n   boolean intercept(StompFrame stompFrame, RemotingConnection connection);\n}\n\nLikewise for MQTT protocol, an interceptor must implement the interface MQTTInterceptor:\npackage org.apache.activemq.artemis.core.protocol.mqtt;\n\npublic interface MQTTInterceptor extends BaseInterceptor\n{\n    boolean intercept(MqttMessage mqttMessage, RemotingConnection connection);\n}\n\nThe returned boolean value is important:\n\nif true is returned, the process continues normally\n\nif false is returned, the process is aborted, no other\ninterceptors will be called and the packet will not be processed\nfurther by the server.\n\n\nConfiguring The Interceptors\nBoth incoming and outgoing interceptors are configured in\nbroker.xml:\n\n   org.apache.activemq.artemis.jms.example.LoginInterceptor\n   org.apache.activemq.artemis.jms.example.AdditionalPropertyInterceptor\n\n\n\n   org.apache.activemq.artemis.jms.example.LogoutInterceptor\n   org.apache.activemq.artemis.jms.example.AdditionalPropertyInterceptor\n\nThe interceptors classes (and their dependencies) must be added to the\nserver classpath to be properly instantiated and called.\nInterceptors on the Client Side\nThe interceptors can also be run on the Apache ActiveMQ Artemit client side to intercept packets\neither sent by the client to the server or by the server to the client.\nThis is done by adding the interceptor to the ServerLocator with the\naddIncomingInterceptor(Interceptor) or\naddOutgoingInterceptor(Interceptor) methods.\nAs noted above, if an interceptor returns false then the sending of\nthe packet is aborted which means that no other interceptors are be\ncalled and the packet is not be processed further by the client.\nTypically this process happens transparently to the client (i.e. it has\nno idea if a packet was aborted or not). However, in the case of an\noutgoing packet that is sent in a blocking fashion a\nActiveMQException will be thrown to the caller. The exception is\nthrown because blocking sends provide reliability and it is considered\nan error for them not to succeed. Blocking sends occurs when, for\nexample, an application invokes setBlockOnNonDurableSend(true) or\nsetBlockOnDurableSend(true) on its ServerLocator or if an\napplication is using a JMS connection factory retrieved from JNDI that\nhas either block-on-durable-send or block-on-non-durable-send set to\ntrue. Blocking is also used for packets dealing with transactions\n(e.g. commit, roll-back, etc.). The ActiveMQException thrown will\ncontain the name of the interceptor that returned false.\nAs on the server, the client interceptor classes (and their\ndependencies) must be added to the classpath to be properly instantiated\nand invoked.\nExample\nSee the examples chapter for an example which shows how to use interceptors to add\nproperties to a message on the server.\n"},"protocols-interoperability.html":{"url":"protocols-interoperability.html","title":"Protocols and Interoperability","keywords":"","body":"Protocols and Interoperability\nProtocols\nActiveMQ Artemis has a plugable protocol architecture.

At\nthe Broker a Sender will have its messages converted into an Apache ActiveMQ Artemis\nMessage and forwarded to its destination or target. A Receiver will map\nonto an Apache ActiveMQ Artemis Server Consumer and convert Apache ActiveMQ Artemis messages back into\nAMQP messages before being delivered.\nAMQP and destinations\nIf an AMQP Link is dynamic then a temporary queue will be created and\neither the remote source or remote target address will be set to the\nname of the temporary queue. If the Link is not dynamic then the the\naddress of the remote target or source will used for the queue. If this\ndoes not exist then an exception will be sent\n\nNote\nFor the next version we will add a flag to aut create durable queue\nbut for now you will have to add them via the configuration\n\nAMQP and Multicast Queues (Topics)\nAlthough amqp has no notion of topics it is still possible to treat amqp consumers or receivers as subscriptions rather\nthan just consumers on a queue. By default any receiving link that attaches to an address that has only multicast enabled\nwill be treated as a subscription and a subscription queue will be created. If the Terminus Durability is either UNSETTLED_STATE\nor CONFIGURATION then the queue will be made durable, similar to a JMS durable subscription and given a name made up from\nthe container id and the link name, something like my-container-id:my-link-name. if the Terminus Durability is configured\nas NONE then a volatile multicast queue will be created.\nArtemis also supports the qpid-jms client and will respect its use of topics regardless of the prefix used for the address.\nAMQP and Coordinations - Handling Transactions\nAn AMQP links target can also be a Coordinator, the Coordinator is used\nto handle transactions. If a coordinator is used the the underlying\nHormetQ Server session will be transacted and will be either rolled back\nor committed via the coordinator.\n\nNote\nAMQP allows the use of multiple transactions per session,\namqp:multi-txns-per-ssn, however in this version Apache ActiveMQ Artemis will only\nsupport single transactions per session\n\nAMQP scheduling message delivery\nAn AMQP message can provide scheduling information that controls the time in the future when the\nmessage will be delivered at the earliest.  This information is provided by adding a message annotation\nto the sent message.\nThere are two different message annotations that can be used to schedule a message for later delivery:\n\nx-opt-delivery-time\nThe specified value must be a positive long corresponding to the time the message should be made available\nfor delivery (in milliseconds).\n\nx-opt-delivery-delay\nThe specified value must be a positive long corresponding to the amount of milliseconds after the broker\nreceives the given message before it should be made available for delivery.\n\n\nif both annotations are present in the same message then the broker will prefer the more specific x-opt-delivery-time value.\nOpenWire\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis now supports the\nOpenWire protocol so that an\nApache ActiveMQ 5.x JMS client can talk directly to an Apache ActiveMQ Artemis server. To enable\nOpenWire support you must configure a Netty Acceptor, like so:\ntcp://localhost:61616?protocols=OPENWIRE\nThe Apache ActiveMQ Artemis server will then listens on port 61616 for incoming\nopenwire commands. Please note the \"protocols\" is not mandatory here.\nThe openwire configuration conforms to Apache ActiveMQ Artemis's \"Single Port\" feature.\nPlease refer to Configuring Single\nPort for details.\nPlease refer to the openwire example for more coding details.\nCurrently we support Apache ActiveMQ Artemis clients that using standard JMS APIs. In\nthe future we will get more supports for some advanced, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis\nspecific features into Apache ActiveMQ Artemis.\nConnection Monitoring\nOpenWire has a few parameters to control how each connection is monitored, they are:\n\nmaxInactivityDuration:\nIt specifies the time (milliseconds) after which the connection is closed by the broker if no data was received.\nDefault value is 30000.\n\nmaxInactivityDurationInitalDelay:\nIt specifies the maximum delay (milliseconds) before inactivity monitoring is started on the connection.\nIt can be useful if a broker is under load with many connections being created concurrently.\nDefault value is 10000.\n\nuseInactivityMonitor:\nA value of false disables the InactivityMonitor completely and connections will never time out.\nBy default it is enabled. On broker side you don't neet set this. Instead you can set the\nconnection-ttl to -1.\n\nuseKeepAlive:\nWhether or not to send a KeepAliveInfo on an idle connection to prevent it from timing out.\nEnabled by default. Disabling the keep alive will still make connections time out if no data\nwas received on the connection for the specified amount of time.\n\n\nNote at the beginning the InactivityMonitor negotiates the appropriate maxInactivityDuration and\nmaxInactivityDurationInitalDelay. The shortest duration is taken for the connection.\nMore details please see ActiveMQ InactivityMonitor.\nMQTT\nMQTT is a light weight, client to server, publish / subscribe messaging protocol.  MQTT has been specifically\ndesigned to reduce transport overhead (and thus network traffic) and code footprint on client devices.\nFor this reason MQTT is ideally suited to constrained devices such as sensors and actuators and is quickly\nbecoming the defacto standard communication protocol for IoT.\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis supports MQTT v3.1.1 (and also the older v3.1 code message format).  To enable MQTT,\nsimply add an appropriate acceptor with the MQTT protocol enabled.  For example:\ntcp://localhost:1883?protocols=MQTT\nBy default the configuration shipped with Apache ActiveMQ Artemis has the above acceptor already defined, MQTT is\nalso active by default on the generic acceptor defined on port 61616 (where all protocols are enabled), in the out\nof the box configuration.\nThe best source of information on the MQTT protocol is in the specification.  The MQTT v3.1.1 specification can\nbe downloaded from the OASIS website here: http://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v3.1.1/os/mqtt-v3.1.1-os.html\nSome note worthy features of MQTT are explained below:\nMQTT Quality of Service\nMQTT offers 3 quality of service levels.\nEach message (or topic subscription) can define a quality of service that is associated with it.  The quality of service\nlevel defined on a topic is the maximum level a client is willing to accept.  The quality of service level on a\nmessage is the desired quality of service level for this message.  The broker will attempt to deliver messages to\nsubscribers at the highest quality of service level based on what is defined on the message and topic subscription.\nEach quality of service level offers a level of guarantee by which a message is sent or received:\n\nQoS 0: AT MOST ONCE: Guarantees that a particular message is only ever received by the subscriber a maximum of one time.\nThis does mean that the message may never arrive.  The sender and the receiver will attempt to deliver the message,\nbut if something fails and the message does not reach it's destination (say due to a network connection) the message\nmay be lost.  This QoS has the least network traffic overhead and the least burden on the client and the broker and is often\nuseful for telemetry data where it doesn't matter if some of the data is lost.\n\nQoS 1: AT LEAST ONCE: Guarantees that a message will reach it's intended recipient one or more times.  The sender will\ncontinue to send the message until it receives an acknowledgment from the recipient, confirming it has received the message.\nThe result of this QoS is that the recipient may receive the message multiple times, and also increases the network\noverhead than QoS 0, (due to acks).  In addition more burden is placed on the sender as it needs to store the message\nand retry should it fail to receive an ack in a reasonable time.\n\nQoS 2: EXACTLY ONCE: The most costly of the QoS (in terms of network traffic and burden on sender and receiver) this\nQoS will ensure that the message is received by a recipient exactly one time.  This ensures that the receiver never gets\nany duplicate copies of the message and will eventually get it, but at the extra cost of network overhead and complexity\nrequired on the sender and receiver.\n\n\nMQTT Retain Messages\nMQTT has an interesting feature in which messages can be \"retained\" for a particular address.  This means that once a\nretain message has been sent to an address, any new subscribers to that address will receive the last sent retain\nmessage before any others messages, this happens even if the retained message was sent before a client has connected\nor subscribed.  An example of where this feature might be useful is in environments such as IoT where devices need to\nquickly get the current state of a system when they are on boarded into a system.\nWill Messages\nA will message can be sent when a client initially connects to a broker.  Clients are able to set a \"will\nmessage\" as part of the connect packet.  If the client abnormally disconnects, say due to a device or network failure\nthe broker will proceed to publish the will message to the specified address (as defined also in the connect packet).\nOther subscribers to the will topic will receive the will message and can react accordingly. This feature can be useful\n in an IoT style scenario to detect errors across a potentially large scale deployment of devices.\nDebug Logging\nDetailed protocol logging (e.g. packets in/out) can be activated via the following steps:\n1) Open /etc/logging.properties \n2) Add org.apache.activemq.artemis.core.protocol.mqtt to the loggers list.\n3) Add this line to enable TRACE logging for this new logger: logger.org.apache.activemq.artemis.core.protocol.mqtt.level=TRACE\n4) Ensure the level for the handler you want to log the message doesn't block the TRACE logging. For example,\n   modify the level of the CONSOLE handler like so: handler.CONSOLE.level=TRACE\nThe MQTT specification doesn't dictate the format of the payloads which clients publish. As far as the broker is\nconcerned a payload is just just an array of bytes. However, to facilitate logging the broker will encode the payloads\nas UTF-8 strings and print them up to 256 characters. Payload logging is limited to avoid filling the logs with potentially\nhundreds of megabytes of unhelpful information.\nWild card subscriptions\nMQTT addresses are hierarchical much like a file system, and use \"/\" character to separate hierarchical levels.\nSubscribers are able to subscribe to specific topics or to whole branches of a hierarchy.\nTo subscribe to branches of an address hierarchy a subscriber can use wild cards.\nThere are 2 types of wild card in MQTT:\n\n\"#\" Multi level wild card.  Adding this wild card to an address would match all branches of the address hierarchy\nunder a specified node.  For example:  /uk/#  Would match /uk/cities, /uk/cities/newcastle and also /uk/rivers/tyne.\nSubscribing to an address \"#\" would result in subscribing to all topics in the broker.  This can be useful, but should\nbe done so with care since it has significant performance implications.\n\n\"+\" Single level wild card.  Matches a single level in the address hierarchy.  For example /uk/+/stores would\nmatch /uk/newcastle/stores but not /uk/cities/newcastle/stores.\n\n\nStomp\nStomp is a text-orientated wire protocol\nthat allows Stomp clients to communicate with Stomp Brokers. Apache ActiveMQ Artemis\nnow supports Stomp 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2.\nStomp clients are available for several languages and platforms making\nit a good choice for interoperability.\nNative Stomp support\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis provides native support for Stomp. To be able to send and\nreceive Stomp messages, you must configure a NettyAcceptor with a\nprotocols parameter set to have stomp:\ntcp://localhost:61613?protocols=STOMP\nWith this configuration, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis will accept Stomp connections on the\nport 61613 (which is the default port of the Stomp brokers).\nSee the stomp example which shows how to configure an Apache ActiveMQ Artemis server\nwith Stomp.\nLimitations\nMessage acknowledgements are not transactional. The ACK frame can not be\npart of a transaction (it will be ignored if its transaction header is\nset).\nStomp 1.1/1.2 Notes\nVirtual Hosting\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis currently doesn't support virtual hosting, which means the\n'host' header in CONNECT fram will be ignored.\nMapping Stomp destinations to addresses and queues\nStomp clients deals with destinations when sending messages and\nsubscribing. Destination names are simply strings which are mapped to\nsome form of destination on the server - how the server translates these\nis left to the server implementation.\nIn Apache ActiveMQ Artemis, these destinations are mapped to addresses and queues\ndepending on the operation being done and the desired semantics (e.g. anycast or\nmulticast).\nSending\nWhen a Stomp client sends a message (using a SEND frame), the protocol manager looks\nat the message to determine where to route it and potentially how to create the address\nand/or queue to which it is being sent. The protocol manager uses either of the following\nbits of information from the frame to determine the routing type:\n\nThe value of the destination-type header. Valid values are ANYCAST and\nMULTICAST (case sensitive).\n\nThe \"prefix\" on the destination header. See additional info on\nprefixes.\n\n\nIf no indication of routing type is supplied then anycast semantics are used.\nThe destination header maps to an address of the same name. If the destination header\nused a prefix then the prefix is stripped.\nSubscribing\nWhen a Stomp client subscribes to a destination (using a SUBSCRIBE frame), the protocol\nmanager looks at the frame to determine what subscription semantics to use and potentially how\nto create the address and/or queue for the subscription. The protocol manager uses either of\nthe following bits of information from the frame to determine the routing type:\n\nThe value of the subscription-type header. Valid values are ANYCAST and\nMULTICAST (case sensitive).\n\nThe \"prefix\" on the destination header. See additional info on\nprefixes.\n\n\nIf no indication of routing type is supplied then anycast semantics are used.\nThe destination header maps to an address of the same name if multicast is used or to a queue\nof the same name if anycast is used. If the destination header used a prefix then the prefix\nis stripped.\nSTOMP heart-beating and connection-ttl\nWell behaved STOMP clients will always send a DISCONNECT frame before\nclosing their connections. In this case the server will clear up any\nserver side resources such as sessions and consumers synchronously.\nHowever if STOMP clients exit without sending a DISCONNECT frame or if\nthey crash the server will have no way of knowing immediately whether\nthe client is still alive or not. STOMP connections therefore default to\na connection-ttl value of 1 minute (see chapter on\nconnection-ttl for more information. This value can\nbe overridden using the connection-ttl-override property or if you\nneed a specific connectionTtl for your stomp connections without\naffecting the broker-wide connection-ttl-override setting, you can\nconfigure your stomp acceptor with the \"connectionTtl\" property, which\nis used to set the ttl for connections that are created from that acceptor.\nFor example:\ntcp://localhost:61613?protocols=STOMP;connectionTtl=20000\nThe above configuration will make sure that any Stomp connection that is\ncreated from that acceptor and does not include a heart-beat header\nor disables client-to-server heart-beats by specifying a 0 value will\nhave its connection-ttl set to 20 seconds. The connectionTtl set on an\nacceptor will take precedence over connection-ttl-override. The default\nconnectionTtl is 60,000 milliseconds.\nSince Stomp 1.0 does not support heart-beating then all connections from\nStomp 1.0 clients will have a connection TTL imposed upon them by the broker\nbased on the aforementioned configuration options. Likewise, any Stomp 1.1\nor 1.2 clients that don't specify a heart-beat header or disable client-to-server\nheart-beating (e.g. by sending 0,X in the heart-beat header) will have\na connection TTL imposed upon them by the broker.\nFor Stomp 1.1 and 1.2 clients which send a non-zero client-to-server heart-beat\nheader value then their connection TTL will be set accordingly. However, the broker\nwill not strictly set the connection TTL to the same value as the specified in the\nheart-beat since even small network delays could then cause spurious disconnects.\nInstead, the client-to-server value in the heart-beat will be multiplied by the\nheartBeatConnectionTtlModifer specified on the acceptor. The\nheartBeatConnectionTtlModifer is a decimal value that defaults to 2.0 so for\nexample, if a client sends a heart-beat header of 1000,0 the the connection TTL\nwill be set to 2000 so that the data or ping frames sent every 1000 milliseconds will\nhave a sufficient cushion so as not to be considered late and trigger a disconnect.\nThis is also in accordance with the Stomp 1.1 and 1.2 specifications which both state,\n\"because of timing inaccuracies, the receiver SHOULD be tolerant and take into account\nan error margin.\"\nThe minimum and maximum connection TTL allowed can also be specified on the\nacceptor via the connectionTtlMin and connectionTtlMax properties respectively.\nThe default connectionTtlMin is 1000 and the default connectionTtlMax is Java's\nLong.MAX_VALUE meaning there essentially is no max connection TTL by default.\nKeep in mind that the heartBeatConnectionTtlModifer is relevant here. For\nexample, if a client sends a heart-beat header of 20000,0 and the acceptor\nis using a connectionTtlMax of 30000 and a default heartBeatConnectionTtlModifer\nof 2.0 then the connection TTL would be 40000 (i.e. 20000 * 2.0) which would\nexceed the connectionTtlMax. In this case the server would respond to the client\nwith a heart-beat header of 0,15000 (i.e. 30000 / 2.0). As described\npreviously, this is to make sure there is a sufficient cushion for the client\nheart-beats in accordance with the Stomp 1.1 and 1.2 specifications. The same kind\nof calculation is done for connectionTtlMin.\nThe minimum server-to-client heart-beat value is 500ms.\n\nNote\nPlease note that the STOMP protocol version 1.0 does not contain any\nheart-beat frame. It is therefore the user's responsibility to make\nsure data is sent within connection-ttl or the server will assume the\nclient is dead and clean up server side resources. With Stomp 1.1\nusers can use heart-beats to maintain the life cycle of stomp\nconnections.\n\nSelector/Filter expressions\nStomp subscribers can specify an expression used to select or filter\nwhat the subscriber receives using the selector header. The filter\nexpression syntax follows the core filter syntax described in the\nFilter Expressions documentation.\nStomp and JMS interoperability\nSending and consuming Stomp message from JMS or Apache ActiveMQ Artemis Core API\nStomp is mainly a text-orientated protocol. To make it simpler to\ninteroperate with JMS and Apache ActiveMQ Artemis Core API, our Stomp implementation\nchecks for presence of the content-length header to decide how to map\na Stomp 1.0 message to a JMS Message or a Core message.\nIf the Stomp 1.0 message does not have a content-length header, it will\nbe mapped to a JMS TextMessage or a Core message with a single\nnullable SimpleString in the body buffer.\nAlternatively, if the Stomp 1.0 message has a content-length header, it\nwill be mapped to a JMS BytesMessage or a Core message with a byte[]\nin the body buffer.\nThe same logic applies when mapping a JMS message or a Core message to\nStomp. A Stomp 1.0 client can check the presence of the content-length\nheader to determine the type of the message body (String or bytes).\nMessage IDs for Stomp messages\nWhen receiving Stomp messages via a JMS consumer or a QueueBrowser, the\nmessages have no properties like JMSMessageID by default. However this\nmay bring some inconvenience to clients who wants an ID for their\npurpose. Apache ActiveMQ Artemis Stomp provides a parameter to enable message ID on\neach incoming Stomp message. If you want each Stomp message to have a\nunique ID, just set the stompEnableMessageId to true. For example:\ntcp://localhost:61613?protocols=STOMP;stompEnableMessageId=true\nWhen the server starts with the above setting, each stomp message sent\nthrough this acceptor will have an extra property added. The property\nkey is amq-message-id and the value is a String representation of a\nlong type internal message id prefixed with \"STOMP\", like:\namq-message-id : STOMP12345\nIf stomp-enable-message-id is not specified in the configuration,\ndefault is false.\nDurable Subscriptions\nThe SUBSCRIBE and UNSUBSCRIBE frames can be augmented with special headers to create\nand destroy durable subscriptions respectively.\nTo create a durable subscription the client-id header must be set on the CONNECT frame\nand the durable-subscription-name must be set on the SUBSCRIBE frame. The combination\nof these two headers will form the identity of the durable subscription.\nTo delete a durable subscription the client-id header must be set on the CONNECT frame\nand the durable-subscription-name must be set on the UNSUBSCRIBE frame. The values for\nthese headers should match what was set on the SUBSCRIBE frame to delete the corresponding\ndurable subscription.\nIt is possible to pre-configure durable subscriptions since the Stomp implementation creates\nthe queue used for the durable subscription in a deterministic way (i.e. using the format of\nclient-id.subscription-name). For example, if you wanted to configure a durable\nsubscription on the address myAddress with a client-id of myclientid and a subscription\nname of mysubscription then configure the durable subscription:\n   \n      ...\n      \n         \n            \n               \n            \n         \n      \n      ...\n   \nHandling of Large Messages with Stomp\nStomp clients may send very large frame bodies which can exceed the\nsize of Apache ActiveMQ Artemis server's internal buffer, causing unexpected errors. To\nprevent this situation from happening, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis provides a stomp\nconfiguration attribute stompMinLargeMessageSize. This attribute\ncan be configured inside a stomp acceptor, as a parameter. For example:\n   tcp://localhost:61613?protocols=STOMP;stompMinLargeMessageSize=10240\nThe type of this attribute is integer. When this attributed is\nconfigured, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis server will check the size of the body of each\nStomp frame arrived from connections established with this acceptor. If\nthe size of the body is equal or greater than the value of\nstompMinLargeMessageSize, the message will be persisted as a large\nmessage. When a large message is delievered to a stomp consumer, the\nbroker will automatically handle the conversion from a large\nmessage to a normal message, before sending it to the client.\nIf a large message is compressed, the server will uncompressed it before\nsending it to stomp clients. The default value of\nstompMinLargeMessageSize is the same as the default value of\nmin-large-message-size.\nStomp Over Web Sockets\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis also support Stomp over Web\nSockets. Modern web browser which\nsupport Web Sockets can send and receive Stomp messages from Apache ActiveMQ Artemis.\nStomp over Web Sockets is supported via the normal Stomp acceptor:\ntcp://localhost:61614?protocols=STOMP\nWith this configuration, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis will accept Stomp connections over Web\nSockets on the port 61614. Web browser can\nthen connect to ws://:61614 using a Web Socket to send\nand receive Stomp messages.\nA companion JavaScript library to ease client-side development is\navailable from GitHub\n(please see its documentation\nfor a complete description).\nThe payload length of websocket frames can vary between client implementations. By default\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis will accept frames with a payload length of 65,536. If the client\nneeds to send payloads longer than this in a single frame this length can be adjusted by\nusing the stompMaxFramePayloadLength URL parameter on the acceptor.\nThe stomp-websockets example shows how to configure Apache ActiveMQ Artemis server to\nhave web browsers and Java applications exchanges messages on a JMS\ntopic.\nREST\nPlease see Rest Interface\n"},"tools.html":{"url":"tools.html","title":"Tools","keywords":"","body":"Tools\nYou can use the artemis cli interface to execute data maintenance tools:\nThis is a list of sub-commands available\n\n\n\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nexp\nExport the message data using a special and independent XML format\n\n\nimp\nImports the journal to a running broker using the output from expt\n\n\ndata\nPrints a report about journal records and summary of existent records, as well a report on paging\n\n\nencode\nshows an internal format of the journal encoded to String\n\n\ndecode\nimports the internal journal format from encode\n\n\n\nYou can use the help at the tool for more information on how to execute each of the tools.

Apache ActiveMQ Artemis also supports JDBC persistence,\nbut there is a performance cost when persisting to a database vs \nlocal disk.\nPut the message journal on its own physical volume. If the disk is\nshared with other processes e.g. transaction co-ordinator, database\nor other journals which are also reading and writing from it, then\nthis may greatly reduce performance since the disk head may be\nskipping all over the place between the different files. One of the\nadvantages of an append only journal is that disk head movement is\nminimised - this advantage is destroyed if the disk is shared. If\nyou're using paging or large messages make sure they're ideally put\non separate volumes too.\n\nMinimum number of journal files. Set journal-min-files to a number\nof files that would fit your average sustainable rate.  This number\nrepresents the lower threshold of the journal file pool.\n\nTo set the upper threshold of the journal file pool. (journal-min-files being\nthe lower threshold).  Set journal-pool-files to a number that represents\nsomething near your maximum expected load.  The journal will spill over\nthe pool should it need to, but will shrink back to the upper threshold, \nwhen possible.  This allows reuse of files, without taking up more disk\nspace than required.  If you see new files being created on the journal\ndata directory too often, i.e. lots of data is being persisted, \nyou need to increase the journal-pool-size, this way the journal would\nreuse more files instead of creating new data files, increasing performance\n\nJournal file size. The journal file size should be aligned to the\ncapacity of a cylinder on the disk. The default value 10MiB should\nbe enough on most systems.\n\nUse AIO journal. If using Linux, try to keep your journal type as\nAIO. AIO will scale better than Java NIO.\n\nTune journal-buffer-timeout. The timeout can be increased to\nincrease throughput at the expense of latency.\n\nIf you're running AIO you might be able to get some better\nperformance by increasing journal-max-io. DO NOT change this\nparameter if you are running NIO.\n\nIf you are 100% sure you don't need power failure durability guarantees, \ndisable journal-data-sync and use NIO or MAPPED journal: \nyou'll benefit a huge performance boost on writes \nwith process failure durability guarantees.    \n\n\nTuning JMS\nThere are a few areas where some tweaks can be done if you are using the\nJMS API\n\nDisable message id. Use the setDisableMessageID() method on the\nMessageProducer class to disable message ids if you don't need\nthem. This decreases the size of the message and also avoids the\noverhead of creating a unique ID.\n\nDisable message timestamp. Use the setDisableMessageTimeStamp()\nmethod on the MessageProducer class to disable message timestamps\nif you don't need them.\n\nAvoid ObjectMessage. ObjectMessage is convenient but it comes at\na cost. The body of a ObjectMessage uses Java serialization to\nserialize it to bytes. The Java serialized form of even small\nobjects is very verbose so takes up a lot of space on the wire, also\nJava serialization is slow compared to custom marshalling\ntechniques. Only use ObjectMessage if you really can't use one of\nthe other message types, i.e. if you really don't know the type of\nthe payload until run-time.\n\nAvoid AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE. AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE mode requires an\nacknowledgement to be sent from the server for each message received\non the client, this means more traffic on the network. If you can,\nuse DUPS_OK_ACKNOWLEDGE or use CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE or a\ntransacted session and batch up many acknowledgements with one\nacknowledge/commit.\n\nAvoid durable messages. By default JMS messages are durable. If you\ndon't really need durable messages then set them to be non-durable.\nDurable messages incur a lot more overhead in persisting them to\nstorage.\n\nBatch many sends or acknowledgements in a single transaction.\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis will only require a network round trip on the commit, not\non every send or acknowledgement.\n\n\nOther Tunings\nThere are various other places in Apache ActiveMQ Artemis where we can perform some\ntuning:\n\nUse Asynchronous Send Acknowledgements. If you need to send durable\nmessages non transactionally and you need a guarantee that they have\nreached the server by the time the call to send() returns, don't set\ndurable messages to be sent blocking, instead use asynchronous send\nacknowledgements to get your acknowledgements of send back in a\nseparate stream, see Guarantees of sends and commits\nfor more information on this.\n\nUse pre-acknowledge mode. With pre-acknowledge mode, messages are\nacknowledged before they are sent to the client. This reduces the\namount of acknowledgement traffic on the wire. For more information\non this, see Extra Acknowledge Modes.\n\nDisable security. You may get a small performance boost by disabling\nsecurity by setting the security-enabled parameter to false in\nbroker.xml.\n\nDisable persistence. If you don't need message persistence, turn it\noff altogether by setting persistence-enabled to false in\nbroker.xml.\n\nSync transactions lazily. Setting journal-sync-transactional to\nfalse in broker.xml can give you better\ntransactional persistent performance at the expense of some\npossibility of loss of transactions on failure. See  Guarantees of sends and commits\nfor more information.\n\nSync non transactional lazily. Setting\njournal-sync-non-transactional to false in\nbroker.xml can give you better non-transactional\npersistent performance at the expense of some possibility of loss of\ndurable messages on failure. See  Guarantees of sends and commits\nfor more information.\n\nSend messages non blocking. Setting block-on-durable-send and\nblock-on-non-durable-send to false in the jms config (if\nyou're using JMS and JNDI) or directly on the ServerLocator. This\nmeans you don't have to wait a whole network round trip for every\nmessage sent. See  Guarantees of sends and commits\nfor more information.\n\nIf you have very fast consumers, you can increase\nconsumer-window-size. This effectively disables consumer flow\ncontrol.\n\nUse the core API not JMS. Using the JMS API you will have slightly\nlower performance than using the core API, since all JMS operations\nneed to be translated into core operations before the server can\nhandle them. If using the core API try to use methods that take\nSimpleString as much as possible. SimpleString, unlike\njava.lang.String does not require copying before it is written to\nthe wire, so if you re-use SimpleString instances between calls\nthen you can avoid some unnecessary copying.\n\nIf using frameworks like Spring, configure destinations permanently broker side\nand enable destinationCache on the client side. \nSee the Setting The Destination Cache\n                                                  for more information on this.\n\n\nTuning Transport Settings\n\nTCP buffer sizes. If you have a fast network and fast machines you\nmay get a performance boost by increasing the TCP send and receive\nbuffer sizes. See the Configuring the Transport\nfor more information on this.\n\nNote\nNote that some operating systems like later versions of Linux\ninclude TCP auto-tuning and setting TCP buffer sizes manually can\nprevent auto-tune from working and actually give you worse\nperformance!\n\n\nIncrease limit on file handles on the server. If you expect a lot of\nconcurrent connections on your servers, or if clients are rapidly\nopening and closing connections, you should make sure the user\nrunning the server has permission to create sufficient file handles.\nThis varies from operating system to operating system. On Linux\nsystems you can increase the number of allowable open file handles\nin the file /etc/security/limits.conf e.g. add the lines\nserveruser     soft    nofile  20000\nserveruser     hard    nofile  20000\nThis would allow up to 20000 file handles to be open by the user\nserveruser.\n\nUse batch-delay and set direct-deliver to false for the best\nthroughput for very small messages. Apache ActiveMQ Artemis comes with a\npreconfigured connector/acceptor pair (netty-throughput) in\nbroker.xml and JMS connection factory\n(ThroughputConnectionFactory) in activemq-jms.xmlwhich can be\nused to give the very best throughput, especially for small\nmessages. See the Configuring the Transport\nfor more information on this.\n\n\nTuning the VM\nWe highly recommend you use the latest Java JVM for the best\nperformance. We test internally using the Sun JVM, so some of these\ntunings won't apply to JDKs from other providers (e.g. IBM or JRockit)\n\nGarbage collection. For smooth server operation we recommend using a\nparallel garbage collection algorithm, e.g. using the JVM argument\n-XX:+UseParallelOldGC on Sun JDKs.\n\nMemory settings. Give as much memory as you can to the server.\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis can run in low memory by using paging (described in Paging) but\nif it can run with all queues in RAM this will improve performance.\nThe amount of memory you require will depend on the size and number\nof your queues and the size and number of your messages. Use the JVM\narguments -Xms and -Xmx to set server available RAM. We\nrecommend setting them to the same high value.\nWhen under periods of high load, it is likely that Artemis will be generating \nand destroying lots of objects. This can result in a build up of stale objects. \nTo reduce the chance of running out of memory and causing a full GC \n(which may introduce pauses and unintentional behaviour), it is recommended that the \nmax heap size (-Xmx) for the JVM is set at least to 5 x the global-max-size of the broker.\nAs an example, in a situation where the broker is under high load and running \nwith a global-max-size of 1GB, it is recommended the the max heap size is set to 5GB.  \n\nAggressive options. Different JVMs provide different sets of JVM\ntuning parameters, for the Sun Hotspot JVM the full list of options\nis available\nhere.\nWe recommend at least using -XX:+AggressiveOpts and -XX:+UseFastAccessorMethods.\nYou may get some mileage with the other tuning parameters depending\non your OS platform and application usage patterns.\n\n\nAvoiding Anti-Patterns\n\nRe-use connections / sessions / consumers / producers. Probably the\nmost common messaging anti-pattern we see is users who create a new\nconnection/session/producer for every message they send or every\nmessage they consume. This is a poor use of resources. These objects\ntake time to create and may involve several network round trips.\nAlways re-use them.\n\nNote\nSome popular libraries such as the Spring JMS Template are known\nto use these anti-patterns. If you're using Spring JMS Template\nand you're getting poor performance you know why. Don't blame\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis! The Spring JMS Template can only safely be used in an\napp server which caches JMS sessions (e.g. using JCA), and only\nthen for sending messages. It cannot be safely be used for\nsynchronously consuming messages, even in an app server.\n\n\nAvoid fat messages. Verbose formats such as XML take up a lot of\nspace on the wire and performance will suffer as result. Avoid XML\nin message bodies if you can.\n\nDon't create temporary queues for each request. This common\nanti-pattern involves the temporary queue request-response pattern.\nWith the temporary queue request-response pattern a message is sent\nto a target and a reply-to header is set with the address of a local\ntemporary queue. When the recipient receives the message they\nprocess it then send back a response to the address specified in the\nreply-to. A common mistake made with this pattern is to create a new\ntemporary queue on each message sent. This will drastically reduce\nperformance. Instead the temporary queue should be re-used for many\nrequests.\n\nDon't use Message-Driven Beans for the sake of it. As soon as you\nstart using MDBs you are greatly increasing the codepath for each\nmessage received compared to a straightforward message consumer,\nsince a lot of extra application server code is executed. Ask\nyourself do you really need MDBs? Can you accomplish the same task\nusing just a normal message consumer?\n\n\nTroubleshooting\nUDP not working\nIn certain situations UDP used on discovery may not work. Typical situations are:\n\nThe nodes are behind a firewall. If your nodes are on different machines then it is possible that the firewall is blocking the multicasts. you can test this by disabling the firewall for each node or adding the appropriate rules.\nYou are using a home network or are behind a gateway. Typically home networks will redirect any UDP traffic to the Internet Service Provider which is then either dropped by the ISP or just lost. To fix this you will need to add a route to the firewall/gateway that will redirect any multicast traffic back on to the local network instead.\nAll the nodes are in one machine. If this is the case then it is a similar problem to point 2 and the same solution should fix it. Alternatively you could add a multicast route to the loopback interface. On linux the command would be:\n# you should run this as root\nroute add -net 224.0.0.0 netmask 240.0.0.0 dev lo\n\nThis will redirect any traffic directed to the 224.0.0.0 to the loopback interface. This will also work if you have no network at all.\n\non Mac OS X, the command is slightly different:sudo route add 224.0.0.0 127.0.0.1 -netmask 240.0.0.0\n\n\n\n\n\n"},"configuration-index.html":{"url":"configuration-index.html","title":"Configuration Reference","keywords":"","body":"Configuration Reference\nThis section is a quick index for looking up configuration.
